JAKE," This job is eating me alive. I can't breathe anymore. I spent all these years trying to be the good guy, the man in the white hat. I'm not becoming like them. I am them."
AMY," Hey! What are you doing, weirdo?"
JAKE," I'm doing the best speech from Donnie Brasco. Or actually, ten of me are doing the best speech from Donnie Brasco. [He stares at the screens of himself.] 'Sup?"
AMY," Get it together, man. Okay?"
AMY," So the store was hit about two hours ago. They took mostly tablets, laptops, and cameras."
JAKE, Sorry.
AMY," I'd like a list of all your employees, whoever had access to the store. I'd also like to apologize for my partner. His parents didn't give him enough attention."
JAKE," Uh, Detective... I already solved the case. We're looking for three white males, one of whom has sleeve tats on both arms."
AMY, And how do you know that?
JAKE," I had an informant on the inside. He's been here for years. Watching, learning. Waiting. His code name? [He holds up a stuffed bear.] Fuzzy Cuddle bear. He's a nanny cam. [He flips the bear over to show the electronic device inside, which appears to be the end of a You got lucky."
JAKE," No, I got here five minutes before you and figured that in this gigantic electronics store, there had to be at least one working camera. [He plugs the camera into the TV screens, broadcasting the recorded video of two guys stealing. We see their face clearly.] Oh! Hi, bad guys! [He looks to the bear] You did it, fuzzy. You busted 'em. It's time to come home."
JAKE,"  I'm not sure if I can. I've been undercover so long, I've forgotten who I am. I have seen terrible things. I haven't known the touch of a woman in many moons."
AMY, All right.
JAKE, Detective Santiago! Don't walk away from me!
JAKE," Yes, I did crack the case. So, Santiago, would you do the honors?"
AMY, I hate this!
JAKE," Ah, yeah. And you're just gonna add one."
JAKE, I'm winning.
AMY, I hate this!
JAKE, It's a good feeling. It's a good feeling. Yeah.
AMY, Enjoy it while it lasts.
JAKE, I will!
JAKE, Charles thinks it was flan. I think it was butterscotch pudding.
JAKE," Oldie gunk. Could be, yeah. Anyone else?"
AMY, Crime techs are at the scene now. We're heading back when they're done.
AMY," Hey, you heard anything about the new Captain?"
JAKE," Uh, no, and I don't care. I just wish Captain McGintley never left, he was the best."
AMY, He was terrible. You just liked him 'cause he let you do anything you wanted.
JAKE," On your marks, get set..."
JAKE, Fire extinguisher roller chair derby?
JAKE, And go!
JAKE, Yeah!
JAKE, What's your point?
AMY," If I'm ever gonna make Captain, I need a good mentor. I need my rabbi."
JAKE," Sorry, dude. But this new guy's gonna be another washed-up pencil pusher who's only concerned with [He imitates a robot.] Following every rule in the patrol guide. Meep morp zeep. Robot Captain Engage."
JAKE, He-hey! New Captain alert. You must be the new C.O. I'm Detective Jake Peralta. Great to meet you.
JAKE," That's not necessary.Or I could recap very quickly, sure. Um, let's see. I think I said some joke about being a washed-up pencil pusher."
JAKE, Which-
JAKE, Meep morp zarp. Robot.
JAKE, Yep.
JAKE," Oh, actually, the last Captain didn't care if we wore ties."
AMY, Speech!
AMY, Short and sweet.
AMY, I love that guy.
JAKE, Same!
JAKE," Hey, man, you okay? You look a little jumpy."
JAKE, I think he's dead.
AMY," Oh, is it? Hmm?"
JAKE, What is happening?
JAKE," Okay, so the perp came in through the window, "
AMY," Shell casing found here. Two shots. Bang, bang"
JAKE," Great work, Detective. You get a tie."
JAKE," That's right, Charles. Good solve. Tie for you. "
JAKE, Now everyone be sure to put those on because it's impossible to solve crimes - unless you're wearing a tie.
AMY, Lay off the Captain. That man is gonna be my rabbi.
JAKE," Okay, first of all, when you use the word ""rabbi,"" you know that turns me on and that's unfair in the work environment. Secondly, your rabbi is a pain in my ass."
JAKE," $6,000 for a ham?"
JAKE," Wow, that's a great story, Charles, thank you. [Charles laughs.] All right, listen up, everybody. Better contact Captain Holt, let him know we got a ten-tie situation."
JAKE, This is fantastic. Captain! Hey! Welcome to the murder. What are you doing here?
JAKE, Yep.
JAKE, Door duty? It's a waste of time.
JAKE, That went well.
JAKE, He's got like super hearing.
JAKE, Let the wasting of time begin.
AMY," Hello, sir. Can we ask you a few questions?"
JAKE, Do you think it's the same dude that left that bong there on the floor?
JAKE," Ah, Captain. You're at my desk. Just what I wanna see first thing in the morning."
JAKE, Not my fault. I had a plumbing problem.
JAKE," Which reminds me, I'm gonna need a new departmentally issued phone. Oh, come on, really? I'm a few minutes late, so you're gonna call me out in front of everyone?"
JAKE," Okay, fine. I was three minutes late. I'm sorry for doing one thing wrong."
JAKE, Uh-oh.
JAKE, It was an amazing solve. I got him to confess in 20 minutes.
JAKE, That one's the dump?
JAKE," Gah, I should've guessed that. He's good."
JAKE," So I won't confuse it with ""undies, clean."" Also, who cares about all these rules? I have more felony arrests than any other detective here."
JAKE," ""Algernon."" ""You guys, Algernon's back."""
JAKE, He's grumpy.
AMY," There are 12 keys of coke unaccounted for, but we just got a warrant to search the dealer's apartment."
JAKE," Well, there's no easy way to put this, Sarge, but someone has been painting wieners on squad cars."
JAKE," And apparently, they won't stop until there's a penis drawn on every cop car in Brooklyn."
JAKE, The butt?
JAKE," Did you just say ""genital-man""? Because if so, kudos, and yes, I have a plan. I'm gonna plant a decoy squad car as bait. Meanwhile, I'll be waiting in an undercover vehicle here. He's already tagged three U/C vehicles."
JAKE," We? You're coming with me? Sir, with all due respect, I don't need backup."
AMY, I studied art history too.
AMY," So basically, everyone's first eight guesses in hangman?"
JAKE," So Holt's coming on my stakeout now? I made a mixtape with some very explicit rap on it, and now I can't sing along."
JAKE," Yes, I still listen to cassettes. This guy is all over me. I mean, a Captain on a minor vandalism case? It's insane."
JAKE," Well, I like the old sheriff. I mean, McGintley wouldn't care about a messy desk or all these stupid rules."
JAKE, Science experiment. I wanna see what happens if I taser this cantaloupe.
JAKE," And McGintley wouldn't care if I was three minutes late 'cause he was always an hour late and hungover, and he would let you do literally anything you want if you gave him a hamburger."
JAKE, Okay. That's very funny.
JAKE, Mixtape.
JAKE, You left without me.
JAKE," Well, I had to put on my undercover minivan disguise. Say hello to Harvey Norgenbloom, CPA, recently divorced father of two with a dark sexual secret. What's your cover?"
JAKE," Okay, so you do not like my ensemble."
JAKE," But the sandals define Harvey. He's a sandals guy. [sighs] Captain, why the babysitting? Why are you micromanaging me?"
JAKE, Yes.
JAKE," Hey, I do take my job seriously. I put away bad guys. That's what matters."
JAKE, That's on Harvey. That's not me.
JAKE," Okay. Counteroffer. I give you 50 bucks, and you let me do whatever I want. Fine. We'll do it your way. From this point on, I'll do every part of the job perfectly, perfecter than perfectly."
JAKE, I was testing you. You did perfectly. Quick update on the tagger situation... He is currently spray-painting our van right now.
JAKE," Ow, ow, ow. Sandal down. Lost a sandal. NYPD, freeze! I'm here. You're busted."
JAKE, We got him.
JAKE," Oh, hey, Captain. Hi, so I was able to procure that $50 after all, and my offer still stands. Let me do whatever I want, and the $40... That's how much I actually have... is yours. No? Fair enough. I only had 30 anyways. Well, I guess in order to get you to stop micromanaging me, I'm gonna have to get back to the most important piece of police work there is: Writing a perfect report"
JAKE, And I'm anxious to restore my status as a lone wolf. [Howls]
JAKE," Yeah, I'm gonna do one more. Lone wolf. He's digging me."
JAKE," Hey, Sarge, do you know where we keep the glitter? Just wanna make sure this report for the Captain is extra sparkly."
JAKE," Look, if I have to do things his way, I'm gonna do them my way."
JAKE," I'm not scared of him, okay? I'm not scared of anyone. Oh, also, The Tagger drew a penis on your minivan. I'm sorry. Please don't chase after me."
AMY," High ceilings, three bedrooms. Why does every perp have a nicer place than I do?"
AMY," Tacky. Not a deal breaker, though. I'd just repaint it."
AMY, Uh-huh. Kitchen. Whoa. Jackpot. There's way more than 12 keys in here.
AMY," Baseboard, behind the hamper."
AMY, Green.
JAKE," Sorry this is taking so long. Still writing up my report. Pretty detailed. Hey, Gina, can you look up what the humidity was about an hour ago and also what moon cycle we're in?"
JAKE," Thanks, Gina. And now to you. What's your name?"
JAKE," I don't believe you. Come on, man. Just tell me who you are. I need to fill this thing out perfectly, so my boss will get off my back. Are you a minor? How old are you?"
JAKE," Okay, you know what? I'm gonna put that in there. And then you're gonna be tried as an adult highlander. And they're gonna cut your head off. Is that what you want?"
JAKE," Hey, look at this. Your prints were on file. Nice to meet you, Trevor Podolski. Oh, Podolski, just like Deputy Police Commissioner Podolski. Your father is Deputy Police Commissioner Podolski."
JAKE," Okay, you know what? Yes."
AMY, 20.2 kilos. I feel like we could round up to 21.
AMY," I’ll call the D.A. Rosa, you log this in. Charles, maybe watch Gina."
JAKE," We gotta let him walk, right?"
JAKE," Captain, I did all the work on this perfectly. I mean, my report has over 25 pages of meticulous research, diagrams, and maps. I even put an “About the Author” section on the back. [flips it to show a dramatic picture of him on the back] I did everything you asked me to do. But this is above my pay grade. You gotta make the call."
JAKE," Yeah, but you think I should process him."
JAKE," Well, if I do, the Deputy Commissioner could ruin my career, and I’ll end up on the streets selling my beautiful body for a can of beans."
JAKE, Has anyone ever told you you look exactly like a statue?
JAKE," So here are my options. One, I process Podolski’s kid, he fires me, and I spend the rest of my career as a detective, third grade, which is literally pathetic. No offense, Hitchcock."
JAKE," Option two, I let him walk, and I spend the rest of my life with Holt as my babysitter. Honestly, when I think about spending the rest of my life with a babysitter, she’s kind of a cute blond named Erica, and she always has pizza money and lets me stay up as late as I want."
AMY, How old are you in this scenario?
JAKE," Anyway, the point is Holt cares more about whether I “do my job right” than whether I have a job at all. So I’m taking suggestions."
AMY," I say piss off Holt, so we get to watch your career end right in front of us."
JAKE," Okay, thank you for that, Santiago. [turns to his whiteboard and puts a mark under ‘dont arrest’] I’m gonna put you down for “don’t arrest,” and I’m also going to put your phone number on every urinal in Rikers."
JAKE, So you’re suggesting police brutality?
JAKE," Hey, Scully."
JAKE," You want this collar? Paperwork’s all done, and it’s perfect."
JAKE," Okay. Boyle, what do you think?"
JAKE," Alright, I’m gonna put you down for “bummer.” And you can hang out in that category all by yourself."
JAKE," Well, my career is over. See you at the bottom, Hitchcock. No offense."
JAKE, Deputy Commissioner.
JAKE," He is at my desk, enjoying a nice glass of bubbly water and some chocolate I was saving for a special occasion."
AMY," Hey, Peralta, when you’re done, can you help me wrap up this massive cocaine bust I just pulled off? [pats Jake’s shoulder] Thanks. Oh, Deputy Commissioner, didn’t see you there. Sorry for interrupting. Amy Santiago."
JAKE, So I caught him red-handed doing nothing?
JAKE," You know, normally, I would agree with you, but I’ve been pretty detail-oriented the last few hours."
JAKE, Oh.
JAKE," You do realize he did thousands of dollars worth of property damage, though, to police vehicles."
JAKE," Would you actually mind just checking out my report? It’s pretty thorough, and I spent over an hour on fonts. Kinda snazzy, so…"
JAKE, Thanks.
JAKE, Have a good one.
JAKE," Well, we don’t have to worry about Podolski’s son anymore. The case is officially out of my hands. No charges filed."
JAKE," The Deputy Commissioner threw my report in Terry’s trash can, and he’d been eating yogurt earlier."
JAKE," Kinda, yeah. I called six precincts about this kid. He’s been brought in a dozen times. Theft, vandalism, drunken disorderly, but he’s never been processed. His daddy comes in and bails him out every time. He’s a lucky little jerk."
JAKE," Alright, I see what you’re trying to do, but it’s not gonna work. I’m not going to arrest him. I’m going to arrest him!"
JAKE, Yes.
JAKE," Excuse me, sir. Trevor Podolski, you’re under arrest for vandalism and destruction of property."
JAKE," First off, the name’s Santiago, Detective Amy Santiago. Second, I’m arresting your son, which, as I say it aloud, seems like an unwise choice, but it’s the one I’m making. Once again, my name is Amy Santiago."
JAKE," Damn, son!"
JAKE," Sorry. Deputy Commissioner, if you wanna pick Trevor up, he’ll be at the Nine-Nine. [walks back to police car] Let’s go, Fartman."
JAKE, I’m not late. I’m here. Right on time.
JAKE," Baby steps, Captain. Baby steps."
AMY, I'm so glad we could finally do this.
AMY," Yeah. Speaking of, this is work. Sorry. What's up, Peralta?"
AMY, Okay.
JAKE," Here. Of course he did. He's a great primary. And I'm sorry I was such a bad number two. I may, for the first time, have been a bit of a jerk, and I'm sorry."
JAKE, The holding cell's completely full. I keep having to separate Hillary Clinton and Kim Jong-Un.
JAKE, Paperwork delivery.
JAKE,"Thank you, Charles."
JAKE," Yeah, maybe it's just Charles."
JAKE," Ohh, strong. Ahh."
JAKE, No Peralta here. Just a normal janitor pushing trash around.
JAKE," Captain, hey."
JAKE," Uh, it did work. This whole janitor gambit was designed to fail. It's just like in chess. Sometimes in order to win, you have to sacrifice your king."
JAKE," Yeah, I used to play with my uncle Bob all the time, and he said I was great."
JAKE, He taught me how to shoot backgammon too.
JAKE," Uh, I'm not a dumb butt. I had a diversion planned. There was just a slight timing issue. Oh, my God! Get down, everyone! There's a big fire! Captain, you better head over there for, like, 15 minutes and see what's going on with that. Beware of the back draft. I'll be in your office. You have beautiful eyes. Have it your way. But you're gonna need this. And... that. It's filthy in there."
AMY, Stop trying to get me to love Halloween. It'll never work.
AMY," Oh, God, please don't. Hey, heads up. I'll cut 'em off at the exit. Okay."
AMY," He ditched the drugs. I'm on it. Ugh. [Groans] Oof, everything is sticking to me. Ooh. Ay, h. Yes."
JAKE," Wait, stop scratching me. We're supposed to be a team."
JAKE, Way to ruin the surprise.
JAKE, All part of my elaborate plan to defeat you.
JAKE," Maybe, if we're talking about who's winning our bet. But if we're talking about who's holding more birds, I'm winning, four-nothing."
JAKE, Yeah. 
AMY,  He high-fived me too.
JAKE," Well, I was gonna ask you to tell the Captain that I brought in royal babies for Diaz, but I'm sure he already knows, since he's always one step ahead of me."
JAKE," Yeah, I'm not really sure that applies here, Gina."
JAKE," Oh, Natasha had her baby?"
JAKE, Yeah.
JAKE,Small world.
AMY," Charles, I had to. Tonight has been awful. Halloween is the worst, and I don't understand why you like it."
AMY, I don't really need it either.
JAKE," Yes, I do. Hit it, royal babies."
JAKE, What... no!
JAKE, Will you stop catching me? Do you have any idea how much I spent on key chains?
JAKE," Wow, that is unbelievably close. 22.76."
JAKE," Okay, look. Tonight has been a little humiliating. Things are not going well, so I'm gonna just throw this out there. What do you say we call off the bet and pretend this whole thing never happened?"
JAKE," What? No. Pfft. I meant to give you an out, so you could save face."
JAKE," Yeah, for you. "
AMY," Captain, sorry to interrupt. Some officers just arrested Peralta."
AMY,They caught him scaling the side of the building with a blowtorch.
JAKE," Captain. Welcome to the endgame. Would you care to shake the hand of the man who defeated you? Forgot I was wearing handcuffs. Ohh, that hurt. Whoo!"
JAKE," I was thinking I had better core strength. I got winded, like, ten feet up."
JAKE," Well, that's not surprising. You constantly underestimate me."
JAKE," Which is precisely where I planned on being. Captain, let me tell you a little story. You remember when I fell through your ceiling?"
JAKE," It was, I admit, a disastrous failure. But it gave me the idea for Herman, the friendly janitor you met. With Herman, I commenced the perfect crime."
JAKE, But you didn't catch Rosa.
JAKE," No, me neither. Of course, I had to find a way to get her out of your office without you seeing her."
JAKE," Oh, the gray pigeons?"
JAKE, And I got it.
JAKE," The four numbers in your passcode. Based on your advanced age, I assumed that you use the same passcode for everything... Your phone, your email, and, of course, your safe."
JAKE," It was at that point that I bumped into a girl dressed as a sexy robot, and we got our flirt on... hard."
JAKE, 'Sup?
JAKE," Oh, it wasn't. It just ruled. And that brings us to five minutes ago, when Amy came to your office and told you that I had been arrested. I knew she's the only one you would believe because, frankly, she's usually too lame to take part in these kinds of things."
JAKE," I mean, really stretched it. I don't know if you noticed, but there were times where I was like, what am I even talking about? This isn't... (timer goes off) Oh. But now, four minutes is up. Which means Boyle is either on the other side of that door holding your medal, or I've lost."
JAKE,"20 seconds to spare. Game over, Captain. Check me."
JAKE, I appealed to their sense of teamwork and camraderie with a rousing speech that would put Shakespeare to shame.
JAKE," [Scottish accent] For too long, we've been put down, ridiculed, made to wear ties! But no more! For today, we defeat him!"
JAKE," Thank you, sir."
JAKE, Captain? S
JAKE,Sir? He's not coming back.
AMY," You know how I think Halloween is for jerks? Well, this Halloween, I was the jerk. I'm sorry about tonight."
JAKE," ""I'm sorry about tonight."" We found the title for Santiago's follow-up s*x tape."
JAKE," ""It's not your fault I was terrible"" is also one of your s*x tapes. (AMY SMACKS JAKE) Ow."
AMY, Halloween is unbearable. But it was slightly less unbearable with you. Don't.
JAKE, Okay.
AMY," Anyway. We're all going to the bar, so get changed, 'cause you can't be the only one there not wearing a 'stume."
JAKE," Ah, Captain Holt. It is so nice to see you. Never thought I'd say that."
JAKE," Yeah, you would've. Way to go all out on your costume, by the way. I believe you have an announcement to make, so the floor is yours."
JAKE, Okay -- you take the little one on the
JAKE," You gotta do it. Santa breaks the law,"
JAKE," Fine. Then I’m going in alone. (to the Santas) NYPD! Santa, stop hitting Santa! The Santas stop."
JAKE, (CONT’D)
JAKE," All right, calm down. Boyle, frisk the skinny one. BROOKLYN NINE-NINE ""Christmas"" Pink Revised Pages 10/15/13 1."
JAKE," Fine. I’ll do it. But if I find any presents, I’m keeping them."
JAKE," Aaargh! Get Santa off me! God, you reek of booze Big Santa gets involved, then Charles -- it’s a melée. Jake tries to pry Big Santa off Charles."
JAKE," Wha-- aw, gross, there’s burrito in his beard!"
JAKE," Knife! Santa has a knife! From behind, Charles KICKS Little Santa in the nuts. He goes down."
AMY, You look happy. Let me guess: your egg sandwich fell on the floor and they gave it to you for free?
JAKE, No. They do that? Why doesn’t everyone just drop their sandwich on the floor?
AMY, I was trying to insult you.
JAKE, And instead you gave me an amazing life hack! I’m smiling because I met someone and I think she may be my soulmate.
JAKE, Do you have these in any other color?
JAKE, Nice. ‘Sup?
AMY, She sounds charming.
JAKE," I know, right? She’s basically Garfield in a hot lady’s body. I’ll take her out for lasagna!"
JAKE," Oh no, Amy, this is embarrassing. I didn’t get you anything. Wait... I did get you something. A nice fresh hot cup of coffee. He hands her a CUP OF COFFEE from off his desk."
AMY," This is cold and it’s tea from yesterday. The present is for Captain Holt. It’s one of six gifts I got him, representing each of the six lessons he’s taught me: determination, wisdom, posture--"
AMY, Oh god. I have to return so many items.
JAKE," Merry Christmas, Chief. And a very merry Christmas to you, Captain. Ho-ho-ho!"
JAKE, Oh! I really came in here with the wrong energy.
JAKE," Of course, no, totally. Why would a death threat be a big deal? Oh right, because it threatens death."
JAKE, Awesome. I love secrets! Santiago got you like six presents.
JAKE, Interesting. And not at all surprising. I’m his favorite. Now what exactly does that job entail?
JAKE, Mmm hmm. Yes. Interesting. Omigod. This is amazing.
JAKE," Well. I would gladly put my life at risk for this man...to have to follow all my orders. Thank you. This is the greatest Christmas ever. God bless us, everyone!"
AMY," Peralta’s busy, so let’s just get started. Now, the captain won’t allow us to give him all the presents we bought him--"
AMY," --but, we can make him the greatest Christmas card of all time! We’re going to wear Santa hats and big sweaters and take a picture of all of us in a line-up."
AMY," Don’t worry, Sergeant -- we’ll add you in later."
AMY," Gah, fine, everyone just go. Everyone starts to file out."
JAKE," Affirmative, Stone Eagle. That’s the Secret Service codename I gave you. I’m just doing my job: watching, protecting, bossing you around. Now, for your"
JAKE," Whoa whoa whoa -- where are you going, Cold Mountain? I changed your codename."
JAKE," I’m only asking this for your safety: is it a number one or number two? Your silence indicates number two. Jake heads to the door, opens it a tiny crack and peers out."
JAKE," Coast is clear, sir. Go go go! Holt slowly walks out. Jake watches him go."
JAKE, Cold Mountain is on the move. Cold Mountain is rolling to the can.
JAKE, Well well well. We meet again. Where exactly do you think you’re going?
JAKE," Negative, Ice Veins -- I changed your code name again -- you’re not going anywhere."
JAKE," Because I am a 21st century Sherlock Holmes. Boyle is my Watson, and Santiago is my Moriarty. I will defeat her."
JAKE, Okay. But your house is off-limits -- protocol. If you really want to get out
JAKE," You’ll love it. She has a great internet connection. Not bragging, just true."
JAKE," Soooo, this is my mom’s house. Just throw your coat in the closet."
JAKE, ...Water closet. My mom is British.
JAKE," It’s a safe house, son! You been protected!"
JAKE," You refused to stay at your desk, you evaded your protection detail. Sorry: I’m ordering you to stay. God, I love giving you orders!"
JAKE, Oh no! We’re handcuffed together and we’ve lost the key! Falconer One to HQ: Stone Eagle is in the cage. Repeat: Stone Eagle is in the cage.
JAKE," I know you think I’m just goofing around, but I was ordered to protect you -- by your boss. From here on out, we are in lockdown."
JAKE," Too late, you’re in it."
JAKE," Fine. But for security reasons, I get to craft the message."
JAKE," Let’s start with a nice greeting, like “Hello, honey.”"
JAKE," Copy that -- “honey” isn’t right. “Hello, husband?” “Hello, sir?” You call each other ‘sir’?"
JAKE, Fine. I’ll give you some privacy.
AMY," Maybe, put Scully’s head on top of the tree like an angel? Nah. Put it behind the tree. Thanks for helping me make this card. You’re so good at this stuff."
AMY," Uh, she never smiles. Is her mouth broken?"
AMY, Oh god. *
AMY, This is awful. We need to get a picture of Rosa smiling. Holt’s card has to be perfect.
JAKE," Okay, my safe house, my rules: this is a no-tie zone."
JAKE, Aaaaaah.
JAKE, Oh no. This is all part of a detailed security protocol. Phase one: no ties. Phase two: sandwiches.
JAKE, A hungry safe house is an unsafe-safe house.
JAKE, It’s terrible! Try it.
JAKE, A fun safe house is a safe-safe house.
JAKE, I win.
JAKE, A “Safe House”-watching safe house is a safe-safe-house-house!
JAKE, Wow. I would not have guessed that. Those are the kinds of things you find out when you’re handcuffed together. And that is the true meaning of Christmas.
JAKE, Who knows we’re here?
JAKE, Get behind me.
JAKE, I order you to be quiet.
JAKE, Just - ugh. You go there. No I’ll be here.
JAKE, Hands in the air!
JAKE," Charles, what are you doing here? I thought you had a plane to catch."
JAKE," I can’t believe you texted Boyle when you said you were texting your husband! As the person who is completely in charge here, I’m very disappointed in you. I’m changing your code name to Bad Boy."
JAKE, I see what you’re doing there. Tushy.
JAKE," Well, I’m in charge and I like to say tushy. Charles?"
JAKE, What? Wait a minute. Old precinct? You weren’t going home. You were going to investigate the threat... because it’s not a hoax. It’s real.
JAKE," You’re lying! You have a tell. When you lie, the corner of your mouth moves. And it just moved."
JAKE, You’re lyiiiiinngggg!
JAKE," Don’t do it, Charles. I’m your best friend slash idol. Don’t make me just your idol!"
JAKE, Don’t do it... best friend.
JAKE, NO!
JAKE, That was not one of the options!
JAKE," So including letters, emails, and texts from a blocked phone, you’ve received ten threats. How many people have you put away that might want to kill you?"
JAKE," Brag. Charles, read the transcripts of the threats he’s received."
JAKE, Kind of obvious. Lame.
JAKE, Better. I would’ve gone the “stapling your face onto my face” route.
JAKE, That’s strange. “Drowning” and “Deep end.“ It’s like he’s talking about a swimming pool.
JAKE, A-ha! Who’s Haimes?
JAKE, The Free-Style Killer?! Why did all the killers you caught have such cool names? The best one I ever arrested was Narrow Shoes Sam. Because --
JAKE," Looks like you need us. Together we figured out it was Haimes, and together we’re going to find him, because together, we can do anything."
AMY," Oh my god! Rosa! I accidentally opene your mail. Look what it says... “Dear Miss Diaz, you just won --”"
AMY," I’m reading the letter, you’re taking the picture."
AMY, You smiled! She’s smiling! And no one has a camera.
JAKE, Move your arm.
JAKE," Captain, you’re stubborn and that’s an adorable quality. But you know what’s not an adorable quality?"
JAKE, Being dead. *
JAKE, I give up! What is going on? Why are you being so weird about this?
JAKE, Wow. I think I would have really gotten along with Young Ray Holt.
JAKE," Well, frankly, right now you’re acting like that same brash dumb detective. If you’d really changed, you’d be saying boring responsible stuff like: “Don’t be stupid. Let the detective squad help you. You’re part of a team. I smell like sandalwood.”"
AMY," Sir, I’m sure you had your reasons for going to Peralta, but this is exactly the type of job I would love to have."
AMY," Thank you, sir. I can’t wait. I didn’t mean -- let’s catch this bastard. Jake walks to the front, large and in charge."
JAKE, Updates. Let’s go. Santiago?
AMY, Looking into Haimes’ known associates. Nothing yet.
JAKE, Boyle?
JAKE, Scully and Hitchcock -- where are we on your special project?
JAKE," Got him! All right, everyone. Suit up. I know there’s no point in telling you not to come. But you’re staying with me."
JAKE, Man. You really take the fun out of saving your life. Let’s hit it! They all CHARGE OUT -- leaving Scully and Hitchcock.
JAKE," Okay. Haimes is armed and dangerous, so remember: watch your six, keep the radio open, and Santiago -- try to channel your lust for me into your police work. There’s too much at stake."
JAKE," If things go south, I want you to know: it was an honor being able to order you around."
JAKE, Yes. What cute little nickname do you call your husband?
JAKE, It’s ringing. This is so exciting! That’s Haimes’s phone. Converge on that amazing ring tone. This guy is awesome.
JAKE, Yes. I knew there was something.
AMY, He’s heading north on track 17.
JAKE," When this is over, we should take a train trip together. Just for fun."
JAKE, I’m Peralta. Not a big deal. Put the gun down!
JAKE, We got him! We got him!
JAKE," Oh my god, sir. It’s happening -- you’re emoting."
AMY, I’m so glad the shrink cleared you.
JAKE," Captain, this is our job. Any one of us would’ve taken that bullet."
JAKE, Oh ho. It appears the student has become the teacher. And the teacher has become--
JAKE, You’re welcome. Team pop and lock! Still?! Come on! We saved your life. Oh my god! We did it! Oh my god!
JAKE, We’re not going anywhere. What you did was amazing!
AMY," For real, Boyle. That was some Superman stuff you pulled."
JAKE," No ifs, ands, or butts. Sorry, it’s just right there. Literally -- your butt is right there, in my face."
JAKE, In the butt. Sorry.
JAKE," Butt, again sorry-- Ow."
AMY, Got it! You smiled! Holiday card complete!
JAKE," He got shot in the butt. Nooooo, strong lady"
AMY, Mm-hmm. Good thing I didn't reschedule my date for tonight. We're never leaving here.
AMY," Please, I'm begging you."
JAKE, Debit card statement. You were at a parking meter two blocks from the jewelry store an hour before the robbery.
JAKE, Could probably just say it once.
JAKE," Oh, uh... "
AMY," Oh, uh, three? "
JAKE," Yeah, I'm just gonna make some copies in here. Perfect cover. Nailed it. So apparently, the new captain survived, and his heart attack not the craziest thing that happened at the precinct today. We kissed, like, three hours ago."
AMY," Yes, we did kiss each other, for reals."
JAKE," For reals-reals. Listen. I know you said you don't want to date cops, but I really like you. "
AMY, I like you too.
JAKE, Good.
AMY, But what if we start dating and it makes things weird at work? 
JAKE," So let's just keep it light and breezy, see where it goes."
AMY, Totally. Yeah. So how do we keep it light and breezy? I know. A comprehensive set of rules.
JAKE," How am I attracted to you? Doesn't matter, I am. Go."
AMY," Rule one, let's not tell anyone so we can figure out what this is first."
JAKE," Smort. Rule number two, let's not put labels on it. We're not boyfriend and girlfriend, we're just ""mrmmzeep"" and ""jinglebin."" "
AMY," Great. Rule number three, let's not have sex right away. "
JAKE," Cool, cool, cool, cool, cool, cool...No doubt, no doubt, no doubt, no doubt. Good rule. No sex, good rule."
AMY," So, should we go out tonight? "
JAKE," Yeah, totally. Maybe 8:00, maybe 9:00. Doesn't matter. We're light and breezy."
AMY, Totally light and breezy. No! 
JAKE," Wow, very chill."
JAKE," Holy Moses, he's alive."
JAKE, What happens when the clock runs out? 
JAKE," Oh, that's fun."
JAKE, What? No. Why? 
JAKE," Charles, we just kissed 'cause we were undercover. That's it."
AMY," Yeah, it didn't mean anything."
JAKE," Not that it's any of your business, Boyle, but the person that I'm taking on a date is a girl from the gym."
AMY," Uh...Whatever, dawg. Date the flooze."
JAKE," See? It's never gonna happen, Boyle, okay? Because I find Amy repulsive, and she finds me extremely handsome. So stop pressuring us."
JAKE," So here we are, officially on a date. Romantical date."
AMY," Yes, we are. No longer just colleagues. Dating. You got a haircut. It looks nice."
JAKE," Oh, thanks. You also got a haircut—at some point in your life. I'm sure that's not your baby hair. That would be crazy. But, uh, yeah, you look very nice."
AMY, Domo arigato.
JAKE, Do you speak Japanese? 
AMY, No.
JAKE," Oh. Uh, sorry. I think I'm feeling a little awkward."
AMY," Yeah, me too."
JAKE, How do we make it not weird? 
AMY, I know. Let's just get super drunk.
JAKE," Yes, great idea. Pardon me, ma'am. Could you please bring us four kamikaze shots? "
AMY, And four for me as well.
JAKE," Ah, I like your style. See, we can do this. We're back on track. We're keeping it light and breezy."
JAKE, So we broke a rule.
AMY, Yeah. I hope it wasn't a mistake.
JAKE," ""I Hope It Wasn't a Mistake,"" title of your sex tape. Title of our sex tape."
JAKE," All right, fine. It started off a bit rocky, but it ended up being really fun."
JAKE," Boyle, I'm not gonna answer that. And no one over the age of 12 says ""french."" "
JAKE, You just asked me repeatedly.
AMY, It doesn't matter to me. I'm—I would never date Jake. I work with Jake.
AMY, Your head would explode...because of how well I would handle it.
JAKE," Captain, everything all right? "
JAKE," Oh, yeah, that means he's about halfway. But in regards to the coworkers, sir, I was telling them I wanted to get more work done, but all they wanted to do was talk about my dating life, knowing full well that my true love is efficiency. You know my motto, sir: cho's before hos. ""Cho's"" is ""chores.” What? "
JAKE, And I do.
JAKE, Yeah.
JAKE, Okay.
JAKE," Well, thank you very much, sir, and might I just say that this has been a Dozerblast."
JAKE,  Okay.
JAKE," Yeah, I'm trying to find some evidence. I'm just gonna look in here. Another perfect cover. Two for two. Nailed it. All right, I talked to Dozerman and convinced him to outlaw all personal talk at work. We're in the clear."
AMY," And everyone hates you for that, but this is totally working, and no one knows."
JAKE, I know. It's the best. And you know what? I'm glad we broke the rule and had sex on the first date.
AMY," Me too, 'cause we're, like, really good at it."
JAKE," So good, right? "
AMY, Stupid good.
JAKE," It makes no sense. We're light and breezy. If we want to break rules, break rules. Like, what's another rule we could break? "
AMY, No making out at work.
JAKE," Okay, that's very flattering, Amy, but there are some rules that I shall never— "
AMY, Let's go.
JAKE, Okay.
AMY, What? Nothing.
JAKE," Ah, there's that candy bar wrapper I was looking for. Oh, Santiago, what are you doing here? "
AMY," Oh, oh, oh. I'm gonna get help."
JAKE," Sir, it's all right. We're getting help."
JAKE," Nothing. We were just working, separately."
AMY," Yeah, and then Dozerman just came in and died."
JAKE," Peacefully, like an old cat."
JAKE, Ah... 
AMY," Nope. Uh, he might have been startled by how far apart we were standing."
JAKE," Right, the surveillance tapes."
AMY," Yep, because this is a police precinct."
JAKE," All right, fine. Detective Santiago and I may have been in there...snorking."
AMY, Okay.
AMY, All right.
AMY, Yes.
JAKE, No.
JAKE," I mean, yes. I just said no because of the rules. We said we weren't gonna tell anyone."
AMY," It's very new, and we're still figuring it out."
JAKE," Hey, so everybody knows about us now, which means all the rules have been broken and nothing bad happened."
AMY," Nothing bad happened? Terry yelled at us, and we killed our captain. Jake, is this a bad idea? It seems like the universe is sending us a lot of signs that we should hit the brakes. Hasn't exactly been light and breezy."
JAKE," Yeah, it's been a little more stressful and death-y."
AMY, You have to admit it hasn't started out great.
JAKE," What do you want to do, then? Go back to being colleagues? "
AMY, Yeah. Maybe that's what it needs to be right now.
JAKE, Okay.
AMY, Okay. Sorry.
JAKE," Boyle, can we please just go to dinner? "
JAKE, What do you want me to say? We tried really hard. We made rules. We kept it light and breezy.
JAKE, Ow! 
JAKE, We were just being cautious.
JAKE, Ow! 
JAKE," Actually, it makes a lot of sense. Ow, I was agreeing with you! "
JAKE," All right, so what do I do? Tell me."
JAKE,"  No, no, no shampoo. That's the worst. But I am gonna go over there. I'm gonna tell her how I feel."
JAKE, Okay. Ahh! 
AMY, Sorry! Sorry.
JAKE, It's okay.
AMY," I was home, and I really wanted to talk to someone about us and Dozerman and about Holt being gone, and then I realized that the only person I want to talk about that stuff with is you. So screw just being colleagues, and screw light and breezy, right?"
JAKE, Definitely.
AMY," Oh, Charles is here."
JAKE, Big time.
JAKE, The Vulture. No.
JAKE, No!
JAKE," Hey, we accidentally startled a man with a genetic heart condition. If you really think about it, his parents killed him."
JAKE," Oh, yeah, we should all check out that race. God. He is the worst captain we've ever had. He drew boobies on my bulletproof vest."
AMY," He heard that I speak Spanish, and he made me fire his housekeeper. She was Polish."
AMY," Listen, guys. Jake and I were talking last night."
JAKE, Charles.
AMY," Anyway, we came up with a plan. Jake is going to...befriend the Vulture so he lays off of us."
JAKE," It's true. I'm gonna bro down with him. If everything goes according to plan, we should be beer pong doubles partners by the end of the week. Now somebody get me a puka shell necklace. I'm going full douche."
JAKE," Okay. Hey, 'sup, bro?"
JAKE, Got a little update for you on that Deberg assault case. Turns out the victim's wife was super hot.
JAKE," True that. So listen, I've been thinking. We got off on the wrong foot here. And I believe it's 'cause we're just too damn similar."
JAKE, Absolutely. We both love premium tequila…
JAKE, Robin Thicke...
JAKE, Gots to have my puks.
JAKE," And of course, nip slips."
JAKE, Hmm? 
JAKE, How so? 
JAKE," So, what, you bugged the briefing room? "
JAKE," Once again, Scully's butt is the downfall of this precinct."
JAKE, What? You can't do that. It's completely against the rules.
JAKE," No, don't do that, all right? I can learn to love nip slips."
AMY, What? He's ordering us to break up?
JAKE," Look, we can deal with this. We just need a new plan."
AMY," I got it. We lie, tell him we broke up, and then date in secret."
JAKE, Great! And you'd be okay lying to your captain?
AMY," Okay, new plan."
JAKE, Uh-huh.
AMY, Captain Holt is here today.
JAKE," Yes, genius! He loves us, and he's got tons of sway in the department."
AMY, He'll tell the Vulture to back down.
JAKE," Yeah, he'll be all ""Vulture, I must insist that you desist."" "
AMY," I really think this is gonna work. Also, if you ever want to bust out that Holt impression at home, I'd be okay with that. "
JAKE," Oh, okay. Duly noted, super disturbing, but I'm definitely gonna do it."
JAKE," Well, well, if it isn't Captain Raymond Jacob Holt. It's great to see you back at the Nine-Nine, sir."
JAKE," There it is, that classic Jake-Holt banter, zingers just flying around. It's like you never left."
JAKE," Okay. Well, I know how much you love hot goss, so you probably heard Amy and I have been dating."
AMY, And we would love your approval.
JAKE, No. But that's not what this is about. 
AMY, It sure is not.
JAKE," Sir, the Vulture is out of control. All right, he told me if I don't dump Amy, he's gonna demote me. You got to help us."
AMY, But we thought— 
JAKE," Well, looks like somebody's got a bad case of the funeral crankies."
AMY, So what are we gonna do about the Vulture?
JAKE, I've got a new plan. Pretend like we're talking.
AMY, We are talking.
JAKE, Exactly. It's working already. Now I'm going to coolly run my hands through my hair. Look where my elbow's pointing.
AMY," It's Davis Garmin, Chief of Detectives. Holt said he could overrule the Vulture."
JAKE," Exactly. The only question now is, will he believe us? "
AMY," Yes, 'cause we're gonna take a page from the Vulture's book."
JAKE," ""The Big Book of Small Butts""? "
AMY, What?
JAKE,  It's the only thing I've ever seen him read.
AMY," No, we're gonna secretly record the Vulture telling you to dump me. Then we'll play it for Chief Garmin. Then— "
JAKE, We're gonna totally have sex on top of each other.
AMY, You get to keep your job.
JAKE," Yes, that."
JAKE," Hey, Captain. I was looking for you inside."
JAKE,"  Oh. Respectful. So listen, remember when you said to me that I have to dump Santiago or else you're gonna bust me down to beat cop? "
JAKE," Oh, uh, sorry, could you say that one more time? I couldn't hear you over the bagpipes. Ugh, one second. Excuse me, could you stop playing that? Just trying to have a conversation."
JAKE," Yeah, I know. We just need two minutes."
JAKE,"  Do you really need to warm up, though? I mean, you're just gonna make a terrible wall of sound."
JAKE," Look, we just need a couple of minutes to chat. That's it."
JAKE," All right, just give it to me. All right? Prepare to hear me play the bagpipes perfectly. "
JAKE, Point proven.
JAKE," Wait, Captain! Sir! "
AMY, Got it.
JAKE," Yes! You're amazing! That was ""We Are the Champions."" "
JAKE," Ugh, it's impossible to find Garmin with everybody mourning all over the place. It's like they have no respect for our sneaky plans."
AMY," I know. Oh, look, there he is."
JAKE," Oh, great. Hi there."
JAKE," Ah, well, that is us. Dozerman and I were pretty much besties. Went on an annual fishing trip together. Cayuga Lake, caught a lot of Coho salmon. We are both so bummed that he's dead."
AMY, Super bummed.
JAKE, Thanks. Blessings to you.
AMY, Blessings? 
JAKE, I don't know. It's my first time in a church.
AMY," All right, how did you do that? "
JAKE," Simple detective work. There was a floral arrangement up front with a picture of Dozerman and 30 of his friends holding a big fish. Cayuga Lake, I pulled straight from the guest book. "
AMY, And Coho salmon? 
JAKE," Well, that's just something I know about from being a man of the world."
JAKE, Sounds disgusting. Do you have chicken fingers?
JAKE, Impressed? 
AMY, Mm-hmm. And horrified by your eating habits.
JAKE," Well, if I'm so unhealthy, how come I never go to the bathroom? Okay, let's get to Garmin."
AMY, Yeah.
JAKE," Oh, Mrs. Dozerman, your husband was a great man. Some of my fondest memories of him were on our fishing trips."
JAKE,"  I did, indeed. They called me ""the Coho King."" Pretty much single-handedly organized those things myself."
JAKE, Uh... 
AMY, Ugh!
JAKE, That's bananas! I had no idea. I was probably too busy praying.
JAKE," Yeah, I did say that."
JAKE," All right, look. I'm not the Coho King. My name is Jake. And your husband was only my captain for, like, a day."
JAKE," No, I'm prostitute Jake. I love prostitutes."
JAKE," Oh, Chief Garmin, wait, I just need to play you one quick recording of my boss."
JAKE," Well, we were just taking a page out of your book."
JAKE," Okay, I know things seem really bad right now, but we just need a minute to think. [Bagpipes] Come on, man! "
JAKE," Okay, so the Vulture has your phone. But new plan— "
AMY," Jake, we've had lots of plans, and none of them have worked."
JAKE," Yeah, but this is a good one. The new plan is: no plan. We wing it! Probably won't work, but I said it with a lot of confidence."
AMY," Jake, you got demoted. We said this relationship wasn't gonna get in the way of our careers, and it has."
JAKE, So what? We'll figure it out. I'll make my way back to detective.
AMY, Or maybe you won't. I'm not gonna let you throw away your dream job.
JAKE," Amy, this is good."
AMY, This is a six-day relationship. We don't know what it is.
JAKE," Ah, a message of hope, right on time."
JAKE," Oh, no."
JAKE," Thank you, sir. I'll take it from here. Very poetic. If I might offer a counter-toast of sorts. Captain Dozerman and I, we weren't together for very long. In fact, as coworkers, our relationship was only six days. But that's not nothing. It was long enough for me to know that we had something special. And sure, there may be obstacles. Him having passed away, for example. But I'm not giving up on us. And I don't care if I get demoted. I just care about being with you...Captain Dozerman, an adult man who has passed into the nether world."
JAKE," Thought I might find you here. So not a big fan of my speech, huh? "
AMY," No, I loved it. I mean, I wish it hadn't been at a wake. And I wish you hadn't kept referring to me as your dead boss."
JAKE," Yeah, it pretty much sucked butt...but still was somehow the best of the three toasts."
AMY, Hmm.
JAKE," Look, I don't want to break up. But I don't want to get demoted either. I just don't know what to do. I'm all out of plans."
JAKE, Captain.
JAKE," Thank you, sir. That's very nice of you to say."
JAKE,  Less nice.
JAKE, Seems like you're just slamming me now.
JAKE,  Really? 
JAKE, Garbage Pail Kids?
JAKE," Sir, I don't know how to thank you."
AMY," Thank you, sir. He totally approves of us."
JAKE," Ladies and gentlemen, prepare to start clapping, 'cause I just made a major drug bust. Talking about four kilos of cocaine, $200,000 cash, and my new partner, a tarantula. I call him Jake Jr., AKA Spidey Klum, Aka Mrs. Doubtspider, AKA Joe Spiden, AKA Tarantula Basset, AKA Spi-dermot Mulrooney. "
JAKE," What? No, Charles, have you seen this spider? That's a terrible name."
JAKE,"  Because they were gonna throw him away, but I couldn't do that to my furry little—ah! He's actually really scary up close."
AMY," Seriously, I'm not going to your apartment if that thing is there."
JAKE," All right, fine, then he'll just live here and help me solve crimes. Get used to him, everyone, 'cause me and this spider are partners for life. He's gone. I left the cage unlocked, and he's gone. "
AMY, Somebody find him! 
JAKE, He couldn't have gone far...Unless he can fly. Can tarantulas fly?
JAKE," Uh, Sarge, I think I found it."
JAKE," A whole hour until we testify. Hey, donut holes. Don't mind if I do. Ugh! Fish? Fish donuts, Boyle? What is wrong with you? "
JAKE," Now, I see that as a positive story. Out of all the identities he could have stolen, he chose yours, and you want to know why?"
JAKE," Because you posted your annual income, you moron."
JAKE, Wow.
JAKE, What are you doing? She's walking away.
JAKE," Oh my God. Sorry, I was aiming at somebody else, but now that I have your attention...Charles? "
JAKE," My work here is done. Ugh, still fish. Oh, God."
AMY," Yeah, when I told my garbage man I was a cop, he said, ""Gross."" He had someone else's band-aid stuck to him."
AMY," Shut up, Ray. I mean, interesting, Captain. I'll think about it."
AMY," Uh, I'll have you know I have swagger. I ooze swagger."
AMY," I think it's a great idea, sir."
JAKE," Hey, where'd she go? You guys were hitting it off. I half expected to see you sitting in her lap by now."
JAKE, Gross.
JAKE, Of course you did.
JAKE," Sounds good, Boyle. Did you get her number? "
JAKE," Oh, okay, okay. So what's the plan?"
JAKE," Okay, seems a little intense, but given how your other weirdness lined up, I say go for it. Oh, here she comes."
JAKE, You look great. I've got a good feeling about this.
JAKE, Charles.
JAKE, Charles.
JAKE," Charles, look down."
JAKE, She didn't say no.
JAKE," Hey, buddy. Got you some of those fish donuts you like so much to cheer you up. Although, full disclosure, I couldn't find where they sold them, so that's just a chocolate éclair with lox on it."
JAKE," Nope. So, what, you're not upset about falling hard for a lady who was immediately thrown in jail?"
JAKE," Wow, look at that. Not to sound overly intellectual, but dem knight boobies is crazy. I get art."
JAKE," Well, they found one of the stolen paintings at her house."
JAKE, Framed. Art joke. Continue.
JAKE, You doodled your wedding invitation.
JAKE, My mistake.
JAKE," Okay, Boyle. I trust your gut. Let's go free an innocent woman."
JAKE," I mean, you know how that sounds, right? "
AMY," Sir, ""fun but not too fun"" was my campaign slogan when I ran for prom queen."
AMY, No.
AMY, Thank you.
JAKE, What? Are you even talking about the case? 
JAKE," Okay, I'm gonna take over the questioning."
JAKE," Disgusting eating habits. Hi, Genevieve. I'm just gonna ask you a couple of questions now, and Detective Boyle will just sit there and keep waving at you, I guess. Now then, is there anybody you can think of besides yourself that has access to the gallery after hours? "
JAKE," What? No. Who asks that? Stop interrupting. Sorry about that. Okay, next question. Can you think of anyone that might be trying to set you up? Maybe an employee or a rival of some kind? "
JAKE, Dirtbag ex. 
JAKE, Okay.
JAKE," Okay. Uh, hey, Genevieve, Detective Boyle wanted me to let you know that he, a college graduate, had a similar theory that it could have been an ex-boyfriend."
JAKE," Wow, it actually worked. I've got to hand it to you, buddy, whatever you're putting down, she is picking up."
JAKE, Boyle has another question.
JAKE, I'm just gonna give the phone back.
JAKE," Hmm, that's weird. Do you think it's because you're the two most disgusting people in the universe?"
JAKE,"  Yeah, check this out. Remember the ex-boyfriend that she mentioned, Nick? "
JAKE," Okay, well, apparently Mr. Butthead just bought a brand-new gallery in Dumbo to showcase his art, which is weird, because Genevieve said he was always in debt. Looks like somebody just came into a ton of money."
JAKE,"  No, Boyle. He probably got the cash from selling the stolen art. Your hunch was right."
JAKE," That's not gonna happen. I will literally never— whatcha gonna do with all that hunch, all that hunch inside your brain? "
JAKE, We should probably leave this prison.
JAKE," Okay, here's my cover. My name is Sherwin Lemonde, sculptor, painter, full-time barista. But once I sell my first piece, part-time barista."
JAKE, Is that all you got?
JAKE," Okay, just let me do the talking."
JAKE," Yes, thank you so much. Oh, wow, I love your outfit. I'm an artist, so I get that it's more than just tight."
JAKE," Hmm, cool. Human chrysalis and whatnot."
JAKE," Yeah, yeah. I have no idea what a chrysalis is, but serious question: If she farts in that thing, does it blow up like a balloon? "
JAKE," You have to, right? "
JAKE, Art is so intense.
JAKE," Look, there's Nick. Hey, man."
JAKE, Is this your work? 
JAKE," It's good. I haven't talked to anyone here, but it almost seems like you're going for a human chrysalis thing."
JAKE," Hmm? Wow. You meant that literally. Very cool. Anyhow, I'm a fellow artist named Sherwin."
JAKE," So anyway, I was wondering. How'd you get your own gallery? It must be really expensive."
JAKE, Totally. It's more about the...other things.
JAKE, Donald.
JAKE," Donald, your glasses."
JAKE," What? No, we're artists. And as artists, we question everything, including certain people's whereabouts on particular dates."
JAKE, Sorry about that. Donald is...sucks.
JAKE," I got to say, Boyle. Nick was pretty defensive."
JAKE, But...They shouldn't.
JAKE, And how would you know? 
JAKE," Oh, okay, great. You wouldn't happen to know where he was on July 21st, would you? "
JAKE," Okay, great. Totally. We'll just go around back and pick up the boxes. Oh, one more thing. Where in this ""cage"" did he go to the bathroom? "
JAKE," Okay, gross. Have a good night."
AMY," Sir, I saw my poster on the subway this morning."
AMY, They put a Hitler mustache on me.
AMY," It wasn't just one. People drew on every single poster. They put devil horns, target on my face, this one says, ""die pig,"" and worst of all, they didn't put the comma between ""die"" and ""pig."" "
AMY," It's not just vandalism, sir. People have real complaints too. ""End stop and frisks.” “Stop racial profiling.” “Unlawful arrest is a crime."" "
AMY," I think Gina was right about the campaign, sir."
AMY, She wouldn't do that.
JAKE," Yep, it's true. He sat in a cage for a month."
JAKE," This is insane. Anything is art. Here, watch this. A statue of Jesus made out of cigarette butts. Boom, I'm a millionaire."
JAKE," I know. And I could call it ""Holy Smokes."" Should we really do this? No, right? That's crazy; you can't just become an artist out of nowhere."
JAKE, What? 
JAKE, Yeah.
JAKE, Right.
JAKE," Oh, no, what's this? It's a receipt for a storage unit that she didn't tell anyone about."
JAKE," Yeah. Yeah, yeah. I'm sure it's nothing. It's totally nothing."
JAKE, It's a bunch of stolen art.
JAKE," Hey, buddy. Sorry about Genevieve."
JAKE," Wait, I thought you only had three dogs."
JAKE," Okay, let me just grab that. Listen to me, Charles. You're gonna be fine. There are plenty of women out there. Strong, beautiful, smart women. How about her? She's very beautiful."
JAKE," Don't be ridiculous. Hey, Scully. "
JAKE, Who's the babe? 
JAKE," Elder abuse, that's nice. All right, fine. We shouldn't be doing this at a precinct."
JAKE," Boyle, you would hate that. Your little hummingbird heart would explode."
JAKE," Yeah, I got it."
AMY, I came up with the slogan.
JAKE," Getting in a little late there this morning, Boyle. Where you been? "
JAKE," Well, there's something in the holding cell that might cheer you up."
JAKE,"  After you left last night, I was thinking about the 24-hour sex painting, ""Genevieve 416."" Check out the date on this receipt from the storage locker with the stolen art."
JAKE," Exactly. She couldn't have rented it, because she was busy getting busy."
JAKE," Do you seriously not hear it, because it almost seems intentional at this point."
JAKE, Because she's in love with Nick. She used one of those latex casts of Genevieve's hand to get the fingerprints so she could break into the gallery.
JAKE," Charles, I didn't do it to be nice. I did it to be amazing. And I think you're a great detective, and I trusted your gut. Go get your girlfriend out of prison."
JAKE," No, you can't say that while you're hugging someone!"
JAKE, This? 
JAKE," Oh, nothing. Just an open-and-shut case."
JAKE, Just some old lady has a missing...torso...that we can't find.
JAKE, But we've already given them all of our felonies.
JAKE, Calvin peeing on the Tasmanian Devil? 
JAKE," Oh my God. Oh my God, oh my God, oh my God, oh my God. Sarge, you got to check this out."
JAKE," Oh, it's so much more than that. Look at these photos. Perp came in through the back window, set up the living room to look like a kid's tea party, didn't steal anything. Do you know what this means? "
JAKE," The perp wasn't there to take anything except lives. Sorry, I always wanted to say that. I think this is the work of the Oolong Slayer."
JAKE," I don't know, maybe he got spooked before the vic got home, or it could be…"
JAKE, Why do you follow people's directions when you could literally pick them up and throw them out the window? Hmm? 
JAKE," Capooch. Uncapooch. You didn't say ""no take backs."" "
AMY," Great, what do you got? "
AMY, Are you asking us to plan you a birthday party?
AMY, Unbelievable. What a waste of time.
AMY," Yeah, fun. I'll just mess up a captain's orders on purpose. It'll be so...I can't even fake it."
JAKE," Gina, my old friend who I grew up with. So good to see you, and I have missed you so much. Is Holt in? "
JAKE," Gina, I'm not here to waste his time, all right? I have an extremely dope, possibly even disgusting case, and I need to discuss it with him."
JAKE," Okay, copy that. Loud and clear. Don't want to cause a problem. I will skraight-up skedaddle with no further a-do-do."
JAKE," Well, Gina said we couldn't be seen together, and I need your help. Looks like we've both got a pretty bad case of jerk boss."
JAKE," I knew you would confirm my hunch. He's back to his cool-ass psycho ways. Great news, right? Aside from a serial killer being on the loose."
JAKE, I'm gonna work the case in secret.
JAKE, Holy crap.
JAKE, Understood.
JAKE," Yeah, how cool—I mean, awful is that? "
JAKE," One, reexamine all the task force's files, two, check all B &Es against the slayer's MO, and three, think of something supercool to say when we arrest him. My leading contender? ""You're going to jail for oolong time."""
JAKE, Right? 
JAKE, That's what globes are for.
JAKE, I would have gone 10. I don't know what port is.
JAKE, To catching a serial killer.
JAKE, I know. I think this is where Batman's parents got killed.
JAKE," Neither did the B&Es, but I traced the label on the slayer's oolong. Turns out he got it at Chang's Medicinal Tea Shop."
JAKE, Why not? Breakthrough.
JAKE," So what's the plan, boss? "
JAKE," Oh, I love that."
JAKE," It's my ginkgo now, old man."
JAKE," This is so much fun. Hit me in the face. Oh, that was a terrible suggestion. Oh. All right. Western medicine rules! "
AMY, I thought you wanted us to surprise you.
AMY," Well, I was thinking a DJ, two signature cocktails, passed hors d'oeuvres—"
AMY, So...no passed hors d'oeuvres? 
AMY, Wow.
JAKE, Partner.
JAKE," He's a maniac. Arrested in '84 for torturing an animal? Oh, this is our guy. Oh, man, just a squirrel? "
JAKE," NYPD, nobody move."
JAKE," Wait a minute, sir. You know what? Screw this.  It's ten days now. Shouldn't have gone back in."
JAKE, I am skraight-up depressed. Amy's been doing her best to cheer me up. She gave me this sticker this morning just for waking up.
JAKE," I know. It's so hot. Meanwhile, Holt won't even talk to me. How is he, by the way? "
JAKE," Wow, that sucks tremendously. Can I have another port? "
JAKE," Yeah, Holt got me hooked on it. I even got a bottle for my house. It's really classing up the booze and take-out menus shelf. Wait a minute. I think I just figured something out. I got to go."
JAKE, Uh... 
AMY," Well, he's not telling us anything, so it was the only way to figure out what he likes."
AMY," I'm sorry, but I believe that hard work pays off."
AMY, Excuse me?
AMY, The Vulture is in a band? Fantastic Jack and the Junkyard Rats.
AMY, I have an idea.
JAKE, Pardon me. Did one of you order the hot plate of justice?
JAKE, Saving New York City from a maniacal— 
JAKE," You kind of interrupted an incredible moment, but here, take that."
JAKE," Sir, take a look at these photos. None of the victims had any alcohol in their apartments. Not even a dusty bottle. You want to know why? Because they were all sober. They all attended 12-step programs, none of them the same one, but they all have the same leader, a creep with a record of torturing animals. I'm talking dogs. I found the Oolong Slayer, and his name is—"
JAKE," Ma'am, I'm not a waiter, okay? I'm trying to blow my friend's mind over here."
JAKE," His name is James Dylan Borden, and he works the night shift at: creep-a-palooza, the mannequin factory in Red Hook. I'll pick you up at 8:00."
JAKE," Sir, we're tracking a serial killer. There's nothing better. We're living the dream."
JAKE," Wow. Never thought I'd live to see Holt side with the Vulture and Wuntch. Mark the day, Gina. May 18th at 4:00 p.m."
JAKE, Really? 
JAKE, Huh. Why would a psycho want to work here? Got you. 
JAKE," Nope, just taking my gun for a walk through the nightmares factory."
JAKE," Okay, slayer. Prepare to go to jail for oolong time."
JAKE, Punk.
JAKE, I said it.
JAKE, What are you thanking me for? You're the one who showed up and stopped him from shooting me in my beautiful face.
JAKE," Sir, we just caught a serial killer. I've wanted this since I was four years old."
JAKE, We did something special here. I'm honored our names will appear next to each other on the arrest report.
AMY," Yep, because everything he does is a prank on himself."
AMY," Aw, that's the nicest thing you've ever said to me."
JAKE," Chief Garmin, thanks for meeting with me. So I have a guy in custody on an attempted B&E."
JAKE," I did. Oh, I should probably also mention, he's the Oolong Slayer, and this is every bit of evidence you'll need to put him away for good."
JAKE, Yeah.
JAKE, Right? 
JAKE," Yeah, pretty easily, actually. I imagine that'll look pretty bad for you."
JAKE," Unless, of course, I decided to withhold that information, keep it just for myself as a secret. Tell everyone it was you who figured it out."
JAKE," No, I actually had something else in mind."
AMY, Captain Holt? This can't be real. Someone please see him before I punch myself in the face.
JAKE," Charles, seriously? No costume? "
JAKE," Remember last year, when you came as that...person and/or thing? "
AMY," Yeah, what are you supposed to be, a sassy car mechanic? "
JAKE," No, come on, he's clearly the rejected Pop-Tarts mascot, Harry Pop-Tart."
JAKE," Attention, squad: today is the most important day in the history of this precinct. For today is Halloween—I thought we were going to say it together."
JAKE," All right. As you may know, for the past two years, Captain Holt and I have engaged in an epic battle of wits. The goal: to determine who must call the other an amazing detective/genius."
JAKE," And last year, I let the captain win, because he's old and sad."
JAKE, It's about everything.
JAKE, Halloween Heist III: The Heistening. Tagline? 
JAKE," I gave you one direction on the tagline—snappy. But yes, we will be attempting to steal the same item: this."
JAKE," And so unto the briefcase goes the crown...Didn't sing it with me. We will need help, so to be fair, we're holding a draft. The captain and I have given up our overtime, so everyone who participates will get the night off. Captain? "
AMY," Okay, brawns over brains."
JAKE," All right, I take Charles."
AMY, I get it. Close friend.
AMY, Gina? 
JAKE, I take Rosa.
AMY," What? Okay, all right. Well, Captain that leaves me with you.  Let's do this."
JAKE," No, no, no. Amy would do anything to win your approval, including pretending to be in a relationship with me for the past few weeks, only to betray me now."
AMY," Jake, you are majorly overthinking this."
JAKE," Maybe, but it's a risk I'm not willing to take.  You're not on my team, Amy."
JAKE, Me too.
JAKE," Here, got it?"
AMY," Hey, Jake. Can we talk?"
JAKE, Yeah.
AMY, You really hurt my feelings by leaving me off your team.
JAKE," Oh, I had no idea you felt that way."
AMY," Well, it doesn't feel great to be left out."
JAKE," Right, totally, I get it. I'm sorry...Captain Holt! "
AMY, What? Why are you yelling at my boobs? 
JAKE," Because that's where the camera is. Nice try, Ray-Ray!"
AMY," There's no camera, Jake. I was being serious."
JAKE," Okay fine—if you're telling the truth, then I sincerely apologize. But since you're not, I will defeat you! Haha! Ahhh! Gah! Scary witch! Scary, so scary! "
AMY," Thanks, that's very kind of you to include me, but I'll have to pass."
AMY," No, I'm not part of this."
AMY, Ugh.
JAKE," Commence operation, ""Oh crap, wrong vent."" Oh crap, wrong vent. This was a mistake."
JAKE," Yeah, we totally blew it. And all because Boyle marked the wrong vent."
JAKE," Unbelievable, mister."
JAKE, I'm having trouble even believing you at all right now. That is the last time I let Charles mark a vent.
JAKE," Never, ever, never, ever, ever, never, ever, ever, never, ever, will I ever, never, ever, ever, ever, ever, never, never, never—I forgive you, and good-bye. "
JAKE," Yeah, I guess you helped a little. But...our fake argument was super convincing. And all of a sudden, we had to make it longer, and we did. Anyways, now all we gotta do is guard this drawer until midnight, and the best part about it is—Captain Holt has absolutely no idea. He is such a fool."
AMY," Sir, do you have a minute? "
AMY," Sir, I want to talk about Jake.  Okay— "
AMY," Hitchcock, not now."
AMY," You're a detective! Get out of here! Go! Sir, Jake really pissed me off, and I want to help you take him down."
AMY, Thank you.
AMY, Why does everyone think that's where a camera would be? 
AMY,  Mm-hmm.
JAKE," Hey, you guys."
JAKE," Oh, he just went downstairs for a bit, but he should be back soon."
JAKE," Um, no, of course not. That would be so fun."
JAKE," No! I mean, you know what would be fun even more that that is if we took a picture right here, and I could have my hand on this cabinet."
JAKE, Nailed it.
JAKE," Take your time. I could do this all day. Matter of fact, what if we did one where I had both hands on the cabinet—one on top, and then one on the front? "
JAKE, What's going on? Aha! What are you doing? 
JAKE, Really? I have never seen you enjoy soda pop before.
JAKE, Have some now.
JAKE," I don't buy it. You're making the same face you made when you found a chocolate chip in your trail mix. Something's up. I'm patting you down. Damn it, nothing but a surprisingly toned set of abs."
JAKE," Yes. Yes. Of course. Of course it's still in there. Welp, I guess I'll see you at midnight. After you."
JAKE, I insist.
JAKE," Oh, is it? "
JAKE," I know, but I had my hand on the cabinet the whole time, so I'm pretty confident there's no way they could have gotten it. They got it."
JAKE, Damn it. That son of a bitch is good.
JAKE," We have to get that crown back. I already changed my email to ""kingjakerulez"" with a ""Z."" Everyone's going to think I'm an idiot."
JAKE, Captain.
JAKE," Yes, it does. Tick tock."
JAKE, But tick tock for who? 
JAKE, I didn't know that.
JAKE, Huh? Will you excuse me for just one moment? 
JAKE, He doesn't have the crown! 
JAKE," Pull the security tape. I'll distract them. Hey, look at this. Ahhhhhhhhhh. Damn it, how did that not work? "
JAKE," Okay, here I am taking pictures with Terry's kids. Man, I look so strong standing next to them. Should I have kids? "
JAKE, Okay.
JAKE," Guy has an insane set of abs. Oh, look, he's got the crown. And he's headed to the break room."
JAKE," Nope, janitor came in and took it. But which janitor? Looks like I'm going to have to squint. His name is Al. Al the janitor. All right, it's 11:00 P.M. now; that means Al's long gone. How are we going to get his home address? "
JAKE, Amy! 
AMY," What do you want, Jake? "
JAKE," What? Why would you assume that I want anything? What I want is to apologize to my girlfriend, who I hurt."
AMY," It's ""whom."" "
JAKE," Why does the word ""who"" even exist if you're not allowed to say it? Anyways, now that I've apologized and you've accepted, can you give me janitor Al's address? "
AMY," This is related to your heist, isn't it? "
JAKE," No, no. It's about a crime. I think janitor Al is going to kill the president."
AMY, Let me guess—you want the janitor's address.
AMY," I never said his name. Well, isn't this rich. After being excluded by both of you, here I am with the power to decide who wins and who loses your little heist."
JAKE," Pathetic. She can't be manipulated, sir. Amy, we are in love. I know we've never said it before, but I think this is the perfect time, don't you? "
JAKE," Amy Santiago, will you m— "
AMY," Enough! Okay. Pretending to be nice to me is worse than being mean. You know what? You want the address? Here, you can both have it. Hope you're happy, you selfish monsters."
JAKE, I feel terrible.
JAKE," Yes, I agree. You definitely should now; I'll do mine later."
JAKE," Charles, I need your butt. Meet me downstairs."
JAKE, When did you come up with those code names? 
JAKE," Okay, he lives on the sixteenth floor."
JAKE," Crap! Looks like we're taking the stairs. All right, it's sixteen floors--pace yourselves. Forget it. Run as fast as you can! Ha ha! I win. I knocked first. You're not Al."
JAKE, The roof?
JAKE, Yes. I did it. I am the greatest athlete in the world.
JAKE," Oh, there he is. There he is! I did it. I did it."
AMY, Nope. I'm your worst nightmare...Amy Santiago.
JAKE," Oh, no."
JAKE, Allow me to explain. Amy and I were ahead of you the whole time.
AMY," No, you weren't part of this. Get back over to the loser side, loser."
JAKE, All right. Worth a shot.
AMY," Well, it all started when I went to tell Jake how badly he hurt my feelings, and he yelled at my breasts."
JAKE," Oh, boy, I am not going to come off well in this story."
AMY," Nope. Remember when you set off the witch? You made Captain Holt flinch, which was weird, since his door as closed, but not weird, since he actually heard it over a bug he planted at your desk. It was in an old muffin that you never threw in the trash."
JAKE, That's why people throw away garbage.
AMY, How are we together? 
JAKE, Eh.
AMY," Anyway, I tapped into the bug's frequencies, so I had ears on Jake. I needed to know what Holt was up to. That's where Hitchcock came in."
AMY," You did one small thing, and I had to explain it to you, like, 45 times. He left a tiny crack in the blinds, so I could read the Captain's lips. ""Sharon and your kids will distract Jake. They'll be here at 9:30 sharp. My waffle xylophone on the cheese man.” "
AMY," My lip-reading is not flawless. Now that I knew your plan, it was simple to disrupt. While Scully gracefully moved the witch, I got into character. Holt triggered the witch, which brought Jake into the room."
AMY," Exactly as I planned. Then I sent you all here, placed an out-of-order sign on the perfectly functional elevator, made you all walk up and vomit twice. "
JAKE," Actually, it was four times, if you count all the stairwell stuff."
AMY," You thought I was just Holt's lackey. And you thought I was just Jake's girlfriend. Well, I'm my own person, capable of making my own decisions, and I decided to humiliate you both."
JAKE," Well, you did, and it was awesome. One last question: where's the crown?"
AMY," Oh, it's at Shaw's Bar, the official site of my coronation."
JAKE," All hail the crown of destiny. And all hail she who wears it, Amy Santiago, the…"
AMY, Queen.
JAKE, Queen of the Nine-Nine.
AMY, I believe there's something else you both need to say.
JAKE, Nope.
AMY," Guys, guys, the marshal gave me good news about Jake."
AMY," No, Charles. Jake is still wherever he is, but since it's been six months, the marshal is letting me write a one-page letter to Jake which she will read to him and then set on fire. Is there anything you guys want me to write?"
AMY, Will do.
AMY," Rosa, anything you want to tell Jake?"
AMY, You want me to write that you nodded slightly?
AMY," Yeah, I'll just tell him that everything's exactly the same."
AMY," Uh, if I may ask, how did you become captain? You just seem a little, uh..."
AMY," No. No, no, no, no."
AMY," I think we all agree that C.J. is, to put it mildly, not very impressive."
AMY," Something has to be done, and I have a plan. We use mankind's greatest weapon."
AMY, The written word.
AMY," I drafted a letter to One Police Plaza saying that we think Captain Stentley is not a good fit for our precinct. If we all sign it, they'll have to act."
AMY," Wait, she actually got that?"
AMY, What?
AMY, Come on.
AMY, Boyle.
AMY, I work here.
AMY," Hey, Diaz."
AMY, Right. The walls.
AMY, I need the crime stats from last month.
AMY," Seriously, Boyle?"
AMY, Honestly? A little.
AMY," I can't believe they all let C.J. and Gina just buy them off. But we don't need them, 'cause we've got you, and you're a sergeant. Did you sign the letter yet?"
AMY, What did he give you?
AMY, What did he give you?
AMY, I'm sending this letter with or without your signature. Enjoy your blood yogurt.
JAKE," We've been targeted by Jimmy ""The Butcher"" Figgis, the mafia boss. We're in witness protection, and that is the full truth."
JAKE, That's impossible.
JAKE, Hello.
JAKE, Wait.
JAKE, Great news.
JAKE, I found Figgis.
JAKE," This is bad. Figgis has the marshal, and now he knows where we are. We're sitting ducks. That's the worst kind of duck."
JAKE," Look, the clock is ticking. We only have one option. Jailbreak."
JAKE, By using this rag-tag team of inmates. Our very own Suicide Squad.
JAKE," All right, let's rally the troops."
JAKE," Hey, fellow prisoners. Hi, there. Everyone, look, we haven't connected as much as maybe we should have. That's our fault. Why don't I just kick things off."
JAKE," I'm Jake, and I like baseball."
JAKE, Now you say something about yourself.
JAKE," Great, so now that we're all ""vibing"" at 100, quick question: If there were to a be a jailbreak ""of sorts,"" how many of you guys would be interested in that? Obviously if you have any moral objection-"
JAKE," Okay, your hands are already all up, so I say we hop on this pony. Great. Now, do any of you have any special skills? Maybe the ability to pick a lock?"
JAKE, Glass eye? We'll definitely find some use for that.
JAKE," How about you, sir?"
JAKE, Uh huh.
JAKE, Okay.
JAKE," Oh, doesn't he? He's been here for weeks. He knows the guard's comings and goings."
JAKE," Thank you for sharing, Evan. You are valued here."
JAKE," Your turn, old-timer."
JAKE, It's always guys like this that unlock the entire operation.
JAKE, What do you bring to the table?
JAKE, And?
JAKE, And?
JAKE," Oh, that's so sad. Okay, so find something for Tito to do."
AMY," So I heard from One Police Plaza. They received my letter, and apparently they also received hundreds of others in support of C.J."
AMY, You know what? Congratulations. You just made sure that a terrible captain will be sticking around here indefinitely.
AMY, Never!
AMY, Boyle!
AMY," Listen, you selfish jerks, that guy in there, the one playing the bongos right now."
AMY," He thinks we're killing it, so he's just staying out of our way."
AMY," He always inspired us to work harder and smarter, to be better. And if he were here right now, he'd be ashamed of us."
JAKE, You swear this guy's about to meet up with his mistress?
JAKE," Well, there he goes. Okay, now we got to get rid of the other deputy. Glass eye, you're up."
JAKE," Oh, so much drier than I would have thought. Did I want it to be wet?"
JAKE, Right! Sorry. Just holding an eyeball in my hand. No big deal. Here we go.
JAKE, Yah.
JAKE," And great. Now we stage a fight; when the sheriff comes in to break it up, we take him down."
JAKE, Yah!
JAKE," I don't know, maybe he's not buying it. Hit me harder."
JAKE, Oh!
JAKE," No, he'd probably love that."
JAKE," But you know what he would hate? Okay, just go with me on this, all right?"
JAKE, Ugh.
JAKE, I can't stay mad at you.
JAKE, Is it working?
JAKE, You have the most important job of all. Tell everyone what you saw here today.
JAKE," We don't have time for this, Tito!"
AMY," Why? So you can show off some new cool thing that C.J. got you? Let me guess, golden suspenders?"
AMY, Dana? Who's Dana?
JAKE," I can't believe we're fugitives on the lam, falsely accused of a crime."
JAKE," Yeah, but we were just doing what we had to do. We're the good guys."
JAKE, This is what they all think.
JAKE, It's time to call the Nine-Nine.
JAKE, What is going on with you?
JAKE," Sir, we just shared one of the longest kisses of my life. I think we can be honest with each other."
JAKE," Captain, it's the Nine-Nine. There's nothing wrong with asking for help from people that care about you."
AMY, What?
AMY," Sorry, guys. I kinda feel like this is my fault."
JAKE," Yeah, but we don’t know when that's gonna be, and we need food and supplies."
JAKE," Holt, are you trying to draw attention to us? Nobody drinks water here. Choose something blue or green."
JAKE," Good choice. (Jake turns and picks up two cans of body spray) I should probably get some body spray as well. What sounds better, Liquid Moan or Turnpike?"
JAKE," I know, but I'm about to see Amy for the first time in forever, and I want to smell like a (Jake pauses and reads one of the sprays) ""Hot New Jersey breeze,"" ugh."
JAKE," Good call. All right, let’s get out of here."
JAKE," Right on, bro."
JAKE," Oh, no. That doesn't matter. We don't need it."
JAKE," No, no, no. Don't do that smoking is bad. You should quit smoking right now."
JAKE, Yeah. I got caught on top of the fence. Check out my calf it's like Scratch City. (We see Jake's legs with a few scratches down them) How about you?
JAKE," Oh, my God! (Jake looks away, pauses, then looks back) Oh, my God! (He blinks and then looks away again)."
JAKE," It's gonna be fine. (Jake then looks at Holt's leg again) Oh, my God!"
AMY," I'm pretty sure there's gonna be snacks in Florida, Scully."
AMY," Shut up, Hitchcock. Obviously, we're all going."
JAKE, I went to a 24-hour vet and got surgical supplies. I was in and out like a ninja.
JAKE," Needles, needles, need- (The stool slips from under him and he grabs onto the shelves, pulling them down on top of him) whoa!"
JAKE, So many dogs!
JAKE," All right. This is gonna hurt. But I'm gonna get you through it. (Jake grabs the pipe but wretches) Oh, God, I'm gonna throw up into your cut. (Jake then turns to face the other way) Ahhh, I saw inside of you. How are humans alive?"
JAKE, Okay.
JAKE," Ugh, what was that sound? I did not like that squish sound."
JAKE, Talking about what?
JAKE," Very much, you know. Oh, God, what if it doesn't go well? We haven't seen each other in a while, and what if it's weird? (Jake turns around to see Holt sewing himself up) Uhhh! (He turns back around)"
JAKE," I don't- I don't know. I mean, maybe we've grown apart. Maybe she'll be repulsed by my frosted tips. I was gonna defrost them before I saw her for the first time."
JAKE, What?
JAKE, Huh.
JAKE, I can't believe I did it. I'm so strong.
AMY," Ooh, we're crossing into Virginia."
AMY," Fun fact: Virginia is not technically a state, but a commonwealth."
AMY," Gross, Hitchcock!"
AMY," No, brake lights!"
JAKE," I tried, but I got recognized."
JAKE, Do you (He pauses) watch a lot of pornography? 'Cause (he pauses again) I'm in most of it.
JAKE, Where are we gonna go?
JAKE, Or Figgis! Do we have any weapons?
JAKE, I would sooner surrender than go anywhere near your gooey body pipe.
JAKE," Oh, no, I'm gonna do it. (Disgusted, he picks up the metal pipe)"
JAKE, Oh!
AMY, Jake?
JAKE," Amy, (he struggles to breath) It's so good to see you."
JAKE, Thank you guys so much for coming. I can't wait to catch up with all of you when this is done.
JAKE," Again, when this is done, Hitchcock."
JAKE," Gina, you look like a fresh wizard, and I love it."
JAKE," So we know that Figgis is in Coral Palms, but we don't know where he is, and we don't know how many guys he's got with him. The plan is to lure them into the Fun Zone and ambush them. Any questions?"
JAKE, Yes.
JAKE," All right, once we get to the Fun Zone, I'll fill everyone in on the mission details. (He points at the crew) You guys come with me. (He then turns to Holt) Captain, you stay here and rest."
JAKE," All right, then stand up."
JAKE," Hey, we never really got a chance to say hi."
AMY, Yeah. Hi.
JAKE, Hi.
JAKE, So everyone's just gonna watch us?
AMY," Come on, man."
JAKE, How did you get there so fast?
AMY, Ugh.
JAKE," Welcome to the Fun Zone. I know the manager, and he's agreed to shut the place down for the day, so there won't be any civilians around."
JAKE," No, those are actually always there something about lead being in the air and water and ground."
JAKE," Anyways, you all have your assignments. Let's plan an ambush. (He pumps his fist) Nine-Nine!"
JAKE," Chills, you guys. Literally, chills."
JAKE," Good call. Blocking the door. Keep it up, smorty-pants."
AMY, Oh
JAKE," Uh Mwah. (He then kisses her on the forehead awkwardly) One of our classic forehead smooches, just like I planned."
AMY, This is weird.
JAKE, Should we have sex?
AMY, What?
JAKE, Huh?
AMY," Yeah. I mean, no."
JAKE," No, things aren't weird, or no to the sex?"
AMY, Maybe we should just-
JAKE," You're right. Just concentrate on Figgis, and we'll figure this out later."
AMY," No, I was gonna say maybe we should talk, but yeah, it can wait till after Figgis."
JAKE, Ah.
AMY, We have the rest of our lives to talk.
JAKE," Yeah, unless he kills us first."
JAKE," What a weird joke. Regret saying that one. Wow, things are (he pauses) clickin'."
AMY, I'm gonna go make sure there's enough balls in- in the ball pit.
JAKE, Yup.
JAKE, Important to get on them balls. (he then talks to himself) What is wrong with me?
JAKE," All right, everybody ready?"
JAKE, Good. Let's set this trap.
JAKE," Hello, Figgis."
JAKE, Thank you.
JAKE, Congrats on sucking.
JAKE, Wouldn't you like you know?
JAKE, You're never gonna find me.
JAKE, I'm invisible.
JAKE," I'm everywhere, and I'm nowhere."
JAKE, And I'm coming for you.
JAKE," Peace out, loser."
JAKE," This ends tonight. (Without looking, Jake throws it backwards. The basket ball bounces off a metal frame and hits Amy in the head) Uh!"
AMY, Ow!
JAKE," Oh, sorry, babe."
AMY, What were you aiming for?
JAKE, Hey.
AMY, Hey.
JAKE," Got you a bag of Blue Rad-berry slushie for the swelling. (He hands the bag to her) I would've just gotten ice, but a possum died in the ice machine."
AMY, Cool.
JAKE, Yeah.
AMY, Why do we keep hurting each other?
JAKE, I don't know. Maybe I'm overthinking it. It just feels like we're not-
AMY, On the same page.
JAKE, Clicking.
JAKE, That was basically the same thing. I count that.
AMY, Yeah.
JAKE," Look, I know this isn't the right time for some big talk, but I just want us to be normal again."
AMY," Yeah, me too."
JAKE, I hope you're a better kisser than Holt.
AMY, What?
JAKE, Why did I say that?
AMY, Why did you kiss Holt?
JAKE," I didn't. I did. We (he pauses) did it to get out of jail, but it didn't mean anything. Just forget I said anything, right? Rewind. (He then makes noises, mimicking a rewinding tape) And kiss."
AMY, Jake-
JAKE," You want to know if there was tongue. I can tell you, decidedly there was not."
AMY," No, Jake. Figgis is here."
JAKE," Okay, well, good talk. Don't die. Holt had very soft lips. Wish I hadn't said that one either. We should get into positions."
AMY," Yeah, okay."
JAKE," Hey, kill the lights! Figgis is here!"
JAKE, I don't think so.
JAKE," Put down the weapon, Figgis."
JAKE," There you go. Oh, yes. I've been waiting for this moment a long time. You ruined my life. I had to live in Florida for six months!"
JAKE," Yeah, it's the most disgusting thing I've ever tasted. It somehow burned my mouth and is cold at the same time. But none of that changes the fact that you're about to go to prison for the rest of your life."
JAKE, What? No!
JAKE, You don't understand. I'm a detective with the NYPD. This is Jimmy Figgis; he's wanted by the FBI.
JAKE," He's lying. ""Constantine Binvoglio"". It's clearly a name he just made up. I'm very impressed. That was pretty good."
JAKE," All right, fine, I will put down my weapon, but you have to promise me you will not let this man go."
JAKE, Thank you.
JAKE, No!
JAKE," How do you think you're getting out of this, Figgis? Do you even have a plan?"
JAKE, Pfft. You're scrambling.
AMY, Let him go.
JAKE, He's not gonna shoot me. He needs me alive to get out of here.
JAKE, Oh!
AMY, Are you okay? I'm sorry I shot you. I thought that's what the nod meant.
JAKE," It was. It was awesome. It was actually just like the end of ""Speed"", which is a pretty good movie. It's not as good as ""Die Hard"". ""Die Hard""'s perf-"
AMY," Okay, Jake, I'm gonna go after Figgis."
JAKE," Yeah, I was gonna say, you should keep going after Figgis. Same page, still."
AMY, Get out of the car!
JAKE," Hey, how's the sheriff?"
AMY," Well, he keeps yelling, ""Disability for life!"" So I think he's fine. Also, Coral Palms PD found your marshal at Figgis's hideout, alive at well."
JAKE," Oh, that's great."
AMY, Yeah. How are you doing?
JAKE," Fine you know, just getting bandaged up. (He turns to the EMT) Actually, can you give us a second? Thanks."
JAKE, It hurts so bad. I just didn't want to seem weak in front of EMT Craig.
AMY," So I know this is weird to say, because I just shot you, but it feels like we're back in sync now."
JAKE," Yeah, I mean, as in sync as I've ever been with someone who just shot me."
AMY, I love you.
JAKE," I love you too. Hey, do you happen to know my blood type?"
AMY, Yeah. B positive.
JAKE," Well, guessed wrong. (He pulls a drip from his arm and shouts out the ambulance) Hey, Craig?"
AMY," Oh, no, a memorandum of admonishment?"
JAKE," Hey, everyone. Sorry I'm late. So, what's this secret meeting all about? You guys know I'm not medically cleared for another week."
JAKE, What? Why?
JAKE," C'mon, guys. I think they're kind of cool, retro."
JAKE," Amy, come on. You're digging the tips, right?"
AMY," No, I feel like I'm kissing Vanilla Ice."
JAKE, There was a time you would've jumped at that chance.
JAKE," All right, you guys got me. I did it as a joke. I kept them ironically. Pretty funny, right? I'm just gonna head out."
JAKE, No!
JAKE," Okay, okay. Wait, wait, okay, okay, okay. Stop, stop, stop, stop. I'll admit it. I went too deep down there in Florida. At one point, I think I forgot where the tip of me ended, and the base of the tips began. Before we just chop 'em off, 'would anybody like to say some final words?"
JAKE," That was one word. That counts. Thank you, Rosa. Okay, I'm ready."
JAKE, No! You know what? I do see it. It's bad. It looks bad.
JAKE," Brace yourselves 'cause Jake-y is back. Don't everybody mob me at once. We can high-five one at a time. Oh, I see no response. A little ""welcome back to the precinct"" hazing. Who's behind this cute little prank? Diaz?"
JAKE, Okay.
AMY, I told you. Night shift has everyone a little down.
JAKE, Murderers? Armed robbers?
JAKE," Wow, that's pretty good."
JAKE," Ooh, cyber crime. Pretty cool."
JAKE," Well, we've all been there. But my point is this: I don't care what time it is. I'm always happy to be here. Nine-Nine! Nine-Niiine! A-Noine-Noine! I'm gonna keep doing it until you guys chime in. A-Noine-Noine!"
JAKE, What is wrong with everyone?
JAKE," Sorry, you can deal with your sick dog later, Boyle."
JAKE," Ah, nasal douche. Cool, cool, cool, cool. Very gross. Anyways, I'm back to being a cop. It's all I've thought about for the last six months."
JAKE," But I won't be fully back until I've solved a case, just like old times. And I can't do that without my partner."
JAKE," Lohank? Oh, my God, you look-"
JAKE," I was gonna say ""less sad""."
JAKE," Lohank is happy and confident? Everything's off. Oh, no. We're in the Upside Down."
JAKE," Nuh-uh, I'm not gonna let the night shift win. Me and my main man Boyle are about to solve a case. Isn't that right, Charles?"
JAKE, Kind of sounds like a male escort service.
JAKE, Even worse.
JAKE, Looks like we're going with the Night Boys.
AMY," I can't believe I'm gonna say this, but the night shift is taking all the fun out of paperwork."
AMY, At least we're getting to spend quality time together.
AMY, What? Where are you going? We have to finish this by morning.
AMY, What?
AMY, Then why are you putting your jacket on?
AMY," The nearest pen store is seven blocks away, and it doesn't open until 9:00 a.m. I learned that the hard way. You really think you can lie to me?"
AMY, A-ha! You're lying to me right now. You do think you can lie to me.
AMY, Wait. Hang on. Was that a lie?
JAKE," Ah, our first case. Tasty little B&E just what the doctor ordered. Not actually, she recommended another week of bed rest. I was like, ""Whatever, dorkus"". Ah, check it out: Ducking under police tape. I missed this. Charles!"
JAKE, I got it.
JAKE, What do we got?
JAKE," Okay, I'm thinking classic us. I'm thinking old times. I'm thinking"
JAKE," I love it although Henri went to an elite international school, so he does not speak with an accent."
JAKE," Thank you, okay, so I break the back window, make my way over to the jewelry case. Meanwhile, you're standing lookout by the front door -"
JAKE, Smoking a cigarette. Check it: Ash.
JAKE, What are you doing?
JAKE, Why do all your characters get STDs?
JAKE," All right, so I go to the first case smash steal a bunch of watches. Move over to the second case smash bracelets. But then, we hear a sound, and"
JAKE," And I know what that means because I'm French, but I ask you to repeat it in English, just to be sure."
JAKE," Yes, we gotta get outta here, so we turn to leave, you flick your cigarette. Using the cane, using the cane, this is awesome. Voila! Zee butt."
JAKE, It comes out when he gets excited.
JAKE," Great news, everyone. We just got our first lead on our first case on my first night back, proving once and for all that absolutely nothing has changed."
JAKE," Yeah, so the door changed, sure, but that's it."
JAKE," Well, we have got ourselves a case and a key piece of evidence. We should be wrapping this thing up in no time."
JAKE," But we're gonna work until it's done, right? I mean, that's how we do it."
JAKE," Sure, yeah, not a problem we'll be home by sunup. Just like a couple of sexy ""Twilight"" vampires. I am Robert Pattinson. I vant to turn into a bat. I've never seen the movies."
JAKE," Okay. Crank up the tunes, Boyle. The Night Boys need an anthem. Something dark, something tough, something-"
JAKE, You know what? I'm into it. The night shift won't slow us down.
JAKE, Why is this going so slow? Where is everyone?
JAKE, You know what we're in a bit of a hurry. Can you run this DNA for us?
JAKE, Cool. Yikes not exactly the A-team at this hour.
JAKE," Yep, totally excited to watch five full seasons of television with you, but could you actually run the DNA for us first?"
JAKE, Because I barely know you?
AMY," Oh, welcome back from your third massive break of the night."
AMY, I was being sarcastic. Where do you keep going?
AMY," Tell me, Diaz."
AMY," Come on, tell me."
AMY," Tell me, tell me, tell me, tell me, tell me, tell me"
AMY," Oh, okay."
AMY, Sorry.
AMY," No, that's all right."
AMY, I don't have to hear it.
AMY," No, you can please stop."
AMY, Please stop.
AMY," You're not Australian, Gina."
JAKE," Once we agreed to go to his birthday party, he was actually pretty fast. But, most importantly, we got a DNA match. We're looking for Dave Smith. Sounds like a real piece of crap."
JAKE," Yep, then we bust him, and we'll be done with plenty of time before Nikolaj wakes up."
JAKE," Hm? Nikolaj, yeah, I said it."
JAKE, Nikolaj.
JAKE, Nikolaj.
JAKE, Nikolaj. I feel like I'm saying it. You know what it doesn't matter. Hit me with the music!
JAKE," Hi there, we just need to pull a file-"
JAKE," That's okay, we'll just go to another precinct."
JAKE, Yep.
JAKE, She's going extremely slow.
JAKE, There we go.
JAKE," All right, we'll just go to Five-Four."
JAKE," Hello, hi, please, file now, hurry."
JAKE," May I? Great, let me just get over oh, good lord, that is porn."
JAKE," It is not. No problem, we just close these tabs. You've got a lot of them."
AMY, It's true what they say: Night shift makes for strange bedfellows.
AMY, Ugh. Rosa? What the hell? She said she was in the bathroom again.
AMY," What? Also ew. C'mon, Hitchcock. Busted."
JAKE," Well, he's about to get a visit from the Night Boys. Gah, this stupid limp is slowing me down. Charles, can you-"
JAKE, What?
JAKE," Actually, I'm good. I was just gonna ask if you'd hold my bag."
JAKE, Yeah.
JAKE," Anyways, this is great. We're definitely gonna catch this guy before sunup, and you will be home to see your kid. Oh, no! Son of a bitch."
JAKE, Ah.
JAKE," Cool, it's cool, buddy. Hey, listen, I know you're with your kid, but I checked the file, and our perp's last known address is like two blocks from here."
JAKE," Yes, there's the Charles I know."
JAKE," Tonight? No, Charles, we gotta go now. You saw this guy's rap sheet he was arrested for attempted mur-"
JAKE," Right, tickling. Look, uh, Charles, this guy's a real doodyhead, all right? He tickled once he may tickle again. He might be tickling as we speak. We could be dealing with a serial tickler."
JAKE," So let's just take him with us. Nah, that's crazy or is it just crazy enough to work? Just crazy. Ah, man, it stinks you've gotta watch him it's really messing everything up. I mean, that came out wrong. I love that you have a son it's not messing everything up. Just messing up our ability to solve the case and have fun. Ah, you know what I mean. I'm a nice guy I'm in the right. I'll just go myself. Bye, Nikolaj."
JAKE," Yeah, whatever. See ya."
AMY," Cool, maybe we can mill around and small talk about how some of us are big lying liars who lie all the time like a bunch of liars, Rosa."
AMY," Hey, I saw you earlier. You weren't in the bathroom. You were on a park bench playing on your phone. Yeah, you left me to do everything while I thought you were pooping. I wish you were pooping. I wish to God."
AMY," Oh, Rosa, crying, don't know what to do. Pat, pat. This feels wrong."
AMY," Maybe he's deep undercover, or he doesn't remember who he is, or maybe he's dead."
AMY," No, Diaz, wait maybe he's just really, really injured. Come on, Amy."
JAKE," All right, Fiske, Jones, Thompkins- Smith. Smith. Whoa, hey, NYPD, freeze! Slow down! This isn't fair! I have a cane. Stop, stop, stop, stop, stop, stop, stop, stop. NYPD. NYPD. I need to commandeer this vehicle."
JAKE, I'm a cop can you please get out of the car?
JAKE, I'm not a thug I'm police.
JAKE, Don't kill people.
JAKE," Look, can you please just get out?"
JAKE, Right.
JAKE," Doesn't matter to me, a perp is getting away. Oh, it's very hot."
JAKE, What who cares about the state's capital? This is the concrete jungle where dreams are made of. That doesn't sound right where dreams are made of?
JAKE," It's grammatically odd. Whatever, I'm sure wherever you're from has strange songs written about it, too."
JAKE," Damn it, all the songs there are so good."
JAKE, I'm chasing a criminal. Your soup is not important.
JAKE, You know that's not what the oath is about. You're making a point you don't even believe in.
JAKE, Damn it! He got away.
JAKE, My thing. Very clearly my thing.
AMY," Because you told us that you're miserable, too. And that means you'll fight to get us off the night shift, right?"
JAKE," It's the Night Boys, and why did I correct you? I would've preferred ""Bros."""
JAKE, No.
JAKE," It's not the night shift, okay? I found the perp, and I would've taken him down, but I'm hobbled, and I didn't have a partner because ever since Boyle had a son, that's all he can focus on."
JAKE," No, I'm just mad because I'm working the night shift, and I have to use a cane, and, yes, the one thing I could always count on no matter what Boyle being there for me is also gone."
JAKE, That's so gross.
JAKE," Ugh, ""amigo"". All right, fine, yes, I'll admit it, it is pretty cool. Boyle's wanted it for a very long time. I guess I haven't actually spent that much time with Nikolaj yet."
JAKE," Man, am I seriously about to take emotional advice from Lohank?"
AMY," Hey, I'm really sorry. I shouldn't have said that about Pimento. I'm sure he's gonna come back."
AMY," Look, when Jake was in witness protection, and I didn't know when he was ever coming back, you were always there when I needed to vent. So, I'll do your paperwork, and if you ever want company on that bench, I'm there."
AMY," Okay, got it. You know what I'll just start with this stack right here. Thanks, Rosa, okay, good talk."
JAKE," No, uh, he actually got away."
JAKE," Ah, it's all right. It's the day shift's problem now."
JAKE, Honestly Lohank kind of talked some sense into me.
JAKE," Yeah, it was so gross, but I want to apologize."
JAKE," Hey, little man."
JAKE," You wanna know something cool? A truck just like this almost killed me today. Uh, kissed me, almost kissed me. Anyway, let's get some trash in this thing am I right?"
JAKE, Yeah. I am silly.
AMY," Attention, squad."
AMY, It's a workplace. I wanted to be respectful.
AMY," As I was saying, it's time for round four of the Halloween Heist"
JAKE," What's up, Nine-Nine? Jake Peralta here to tell you that tonight is the night for the Halloween-"
JAKE," What? Ames, what are you doing? I always announce the heist."
AMY, Exercising my right to announce the heist as the defending champion.
JAKE, Defending champion. The only reason you won is 'cause no one knew you were even playing. It was a pathetic act of pure cowardice.
JAKE," Not tonight, she isn't. Although don't kiss anyone else. I love you so much. Now, then, this one's for all-"
JAKE, Such a dork.
AMY, So cool.
JAKE," Yeah, well, this has-been has been with yo' mama all week. Sorry, I feel like I crossed a line; I apologize."
JAKE," This year's Halloween Heist is a three-way tiebreaker to determine the champion of champions. We'll be playing for this: a plaque that reads, ""The Ultimate Detective/Genius""."
AMY, It's fun to see you so passionate.
JAKE, Huh. Is it weird that that turned me on a little bit? Doesn't matter. But let's move on. The plaque will be held in this.
AMY, Is that my childhood caboodle?
JAKE," It most certainly is, but don't worry. I removed the scrunchies, old report cards, and photos of young Al Gore. I'm better-looking than him anyway."
JAKE," Okay, stings a little bit. It will be secured with this brand-new lock. Hitchcock, if you would do the honors. There you are."
JAKE," Nope, don't ever need it back. Now, then, locking the caboodle."
JAKE," Right, and what is the name of the store at the mall that sells the sticky pastries?"
JAKE," Yeah, that was it. Thanks. Continue."
JAKE, Interesting. Interesting.
AMY," Oh, Terry, Terry, Terry."
JAKE," If you have nothing to hide, then I'm sure you won't mind me asking Hitchcock and Scully to keep an eye on you."
JAKE," Great! It's now time to choose from the remaining players. Amy, since you're last year's champion, you go first."
AMY, I choose Rosa.
JAKE, What?
JAKE," Absolutely not. I'm just surprised, because you have such a strong connection with Gina. But I'm glad she's on my team. I had absolutely nothing planned for Charles."
JAKE, I totally planned everything for Charles. This is a nightmare!
JAKE, Roller-skate like an angel.
JAKE, I have definitely forgotten that.
JAKE," Except look exactly like the body double I got for him. Bill, you can come out now."
AMY,So I believe the key to good teamwork is an equal exchange of ideas-
AMY," Okay, but it's not a binder. It's a virtual binder, and it's encrypted on this flash drive."
AMY, Inside the key chain. It's a frickin' hologram.
JAKE," As expected, all eyes are on the caboodle. It's go time. Now, Gina."
JAKE," Looks like nobody's onto us. Go, Gina! So, Bill, do you have a real job or-"
JAKE," Hmm, strange, the random person I hired off the streets of Brooklyn is a weirdo."
JAKE," Hmm? Nothing. There she goes. Now, Bill, the key here is that I came in before work and replaced the door handles with ones that lock from the outside. Pretty smart. All right, Bill. The time is now. Show your face. Show your face to the world!"
JAKE," And here comes Jake! Whoo! Welcome to the big show. I was gonna sneak the plaque out without anybody knowing, but then I thought so much more fun to make you watch. Now enjoy as I steal the plaque of destiny. Ah, trying to pick the lock, El Capitán? That'll take at least three minutes, by which time I will have hidden this plaque somewhere you will never find it. Voilà. Of course, you could break the window, but you would never knowingly destroy government property, would you? Whoop! Well, misread that one."
JAKE," Oh! Gina, are you okay?"
JAKE," Totally, girl! You look good!"
JAKE," I'm so sorry, Gina. It should have been Charles on those skates."
JAKE," Yeah, none. All right, Gina, get your stuff. I'm taking you to the dentist."
AMY," With all due respect, sir, I don't think that's the best idea. The blood is dry. We can just clean it up after."
JAKE," Ah, I love tonight. However, there is the small issue of me losing my partner. Now, Terry, I know that you were upset that no one picked you earlier."
JAKE," Regardless, please be my partner, please, please, please, please, please, please."
JAKE," You're dumb, and I have heist to do. Overreacted. Damn it! You know what? Forget Terry. At the time of the accident, my team had the plaque, so I will just grab it and give myself a four-minute head start."
JAKE," What? But my team had it. Charles, tell him."
JAKE," Charles, what are you saying?"
AMY," You used their code names. You read the plans, addenda and all!"
AMY," And you didn't make fun of me for basing it all on ""The Baby-Sitters Club""."
AMY, You did?
AMY, I am! It's true!
JAKE," Thanks for coming back, Bill. I really needed a teammate."
JAKE, Yeah. You can take the wig off if you want.
JAKE," Could you stop saying that, Bill? It's making me a little uncomfortable."
JAKE," Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. Holt hates pizza. He's trying to distract us."
JAKE," Bill is not a male prostitute, I don't think."
AMY, What's going on?
AMY, Which one of you bozos did this?
JAKE, Us? You know how much planning it takes to get this many pizza guys here at the same time? A binder full of planning. This has Amy written all over it.
AMY," If I had done this, it would say ""Captain Raymond Holt"". I'm not going to disrespect you, sir, even for the sake of the heist."
AMY, You're not leaving my sight.
JAKE," Bill, can you see what's going on? Do you have eyes on Charles and Rosa?"
JAKE, Hitchcock! Scully! Follow Terry!
JAKE, Aah! I'm getting bounced around like a pinball!
AMY, This is madness!
JAKE," Everyone with a pizza, get out of here! The caboodle!"
AMY, The caboodle!
JAKE," I know one of you took the plaque. And I swear on my living mother's future grave, I'm not gonna let you get away with it."
AMY, It's true. You had it for breakfast this morning.
JAKE," When pizza's on a bagel, you can eat pizza anytime!"
JAKE," Were they, or perhaps were they distracted by your brilliant pizza ruse?"
AMY," You're suspect number one, Jeffords."
AMY," Still a long time till sunup. All I have to say is, whoever took that plaque, you better watch out. Come on, Rosa."
JAKE, Come on Bill.
AMY," Okay, was the operation a success?"
AMY, Beautiful execution.
AMY," Oh, my God, I don't want tonight to ever end. Did you by chance read the excerpt from ""The Truth About Stacey""?"
AMY," That get caught smoking cigarettes? Well, let's just say that these two baby-sitters aren't getting caught with squat. This is where I stash a few cigarettes on the rare occasion that I need a puff."
AMY, She's a work in progress.
AMY, What is it? What? I got to go.
JAKE," Time is running out. We got to stop playing by the rules and start playing dirty. Follow my lead, Bill."
JAKE," Why? You know what? Never mind. It doesn't matter. Hey, Charles! Charles, get in here. Come on. What is Holt up to? Does he have the plaque? Does he know who does?"
JAKE," Okay, fine, then I guess I have a new best friend, and his name is Bill."
JAKE," Sure, it started out that way, but you know how these things go, spending time together, sharing intimate secrets, laughing about nothing in particular."
JAKE," Thanks, bud. We will always be best friends."
JAKE, Ain't she a beaut?
JAKE," Immediately ruined it, Bill. Immediately."
JAKE, Here you go.
JAKE, What is happening right now?
JAKE," Uh, but you did."
JAKE, Then how do you explain this?
JAKE, What the hell?
AMY," Yeah, I just got it out of the vent to rub it in your faces."
JAKE," ""I Just Got It Out of the Vent to Rub It in Your Faces""; name of your sex tape. What?"
AMY," Oh, my God. Our precinct is disgusting."
JAKE, Wait. Look at the plaques.
JAKE," ""Are""."
JAKE," ""Dumb"". Are heists dumb? Of course not. That was a stupid question."
AMY," No, Jake, it's says, ""Heists are dumb""."
JAKE, The Oscar for best liar goes to you!
AMY," Not to be harsh, Sarge, but you're setting a terrible example for your daughters, and they're gonna grow up to be total failures."
JAKE," Gina! Of course! It all makes sense, except for the parts I don't understand and the fact that I still kind of think Terry did this."
JAKE, But you knocked out your two front teeth.
JAKE," Oh, you made sure I didn't remember that!"
JAKE, Maybe I just wasn't at that party.
AMY, This feels like it's gonna be a dig on me.
AMY, There it is.
JAKE," Bill is not a male prostitute, I don't think."
AMY, That suit is not drab. It has a fun salmon lining.
JAKE," Then we raced in here to blame Terry, and you trapped us. But how did you know he was gonna say ""heists are dumb""?"
AMY, Because you wanted to win?
JAKE," God, Nikolaj is having such a rich childhood."
JAKE," Well, she's gonna be so psyched that you're back."
AMY, Aww. It's so sweet.
AMY, And violent.
JAKE," Yeah, this is awkward. I'm sure they'll stop soon."
JAKE, And it's escalating. Let's go.
JAKE," Aw. I love ""You've Got Mail""."
JAKE, I know.
AMY," Wait, hold up. Planning a wedding like that in 14 hours would be the greatest organizational challenge in history. How are you gonna do it?"
AMY, I thought I was supposed to get you guys the wedding present! (She laughs and claps) Of course I will!
AMY," (She cheerfully sighs and walks towards Rosa and Pimento before turning around to address the rest of the squad) All right. Listen up, people. The next 14 hours are gonna be hell, but in the end you will have the satisfaction of knowing that you've finally done something worthwhile with your lives."
AMY," Eh-eh-eh! (Amy raises her voice) I don't have time to stroke your damn ego, Sergeant. Let's make a wedding!"
JAKE," Of course. Anything. Except killing someone, or maiming someone, or breaking the law in any way, or nudity. Also I don't like waking up super early in the morning you know what, why don't you just tell me what you want?"
JAKE, Neustadter's like six hours away. I'm not so sure we can get there and back in time.
JAKE," Blessed, totally blessed. I'll do it, it's fine. But I should warn you, my car is a piece of junk and it's always breaking down."
JAKE," Turning to Gina That was amazing. He actually listens to you. Hey, you should come with us on this trip. You know, in case he starts acting-"
JAKE, Yes. You can use your powers to keep him in check.
JAKE, Mm.
JAKE, And also you're not a cop.
JAKE, So you will come with us?
JAKE, Pointing at Gina You da man!
JAKE," See ya in the car, girl."
AMY," Okay. First, the good news. I've generated a detailed timeline broken down into 30-second increments to keep us on track. The bad news: we're already 16.5 increments behind schedule."
AMY," Good! Use it! Neil Armstrong was overwhelmed when he walked on the Moon, but you know what he did? He walked on the Moon! Charles, you're in charge of food."
AMY," Terry, you're on hair and makeup. I've seen your little girls' pigtails, so I know you can do it."
AMY," Pull it together, Jeffords! Scully and Hitchcock, you're in charge of seating."
AMY," Great. And, Captain, you can help me decorate."
AMY," Well, we just wanna keep it classy."
AMY, What?
AMY," Okay, Rosa. You go to the office, have a couple bellinis, and just relax."
AMY, Peach juice and champagne.
AMY," Come on, just try it. It's what Nancy Meyers would drink."
JAKE," So, big day. How you feeling, buddy?"
JAKE," You know, it's possible you're just hungry. When's the last time you ate?"
JAKE, Ah.
JAKE," All right, we're looking for 381 Smith Street. It should be up here. Hopefully they still have your earrings."
JAKE," Uh, it's okay. Everything's gonna be fine. We'll think of something, all right?"
JAKE," Come on. I mean, they're just earrings, right? We can get another pair, (Pimento looks shocked) or we could make some new ones. All we need is, like, a blacksmith. Or a smelter a smelt man- that can't be right. The point is you can still married."
JAKE," Well, I personally don't even really believe in signs, so-"
JAKE, Ah
JAKE," Okay, good point. (He turns to Gina) Hey, Gina, I could use your help here. You wanna maybe weigh in on this one?"
JAKE, What? No! You weighed in wrong.
JAKE, What if there was something in the universe that could prove to you that you should still get married? What would that be?
JAKE," Okay, so the earrings. (Jake starts typing on his phone) Maybe somebody bought them before the place burned down, right? We could track 'em down. And lookee here. (He holds his phone up) I just got the owner's name. That's good, right?"
JAKE," (Snaps his fingers) You're damn right there is. (He then looks up and points at the sky) Suck it, universe!"
AMY," How are the chairs coming, guys?"
AMY, Okay. So we'll go with that one?
AMY," Wow, you're taking this really seriously."
AMY," Mm-hmm. (She leans forwards and tastes the batter. Hmm, (she makes an unsure face) I think it's a little off."
AMY," Whoa, you really made the balloon arch."
AMY," Yes, you and I think that, but what will Rosa think?"
AMY, What?
AMY, Rosa? No. How?
JAKE," Well, not necessarily. I mean, maybe the universe allowed something else to survive, you know? Like a rabbit's foot."
JAKE, I don't think you understand how they work. Yours burned down! I'm so sorry you lost everything. I'm just really worked up.
JAKE," No, please don't!"
JAKE," Okay, so I know that seemed like a little bit of a dead end. (He chuckles)"
JAKE, She does?
JAKE, Are you sure it's the same necklace?
JAKE," I stand corrected. All right, I'm gonna call the local police and get a warrant. (He starts typing on his phone."
JAKE," No! No, no, no. That's a bad idea."
JAKE, No!
JAKE, What are you doing?
JAKE," Trying to keep us out of prison. You know what, forget it. I'll just deal with him myself (he turns around to see where Pimento went) nope, he's already on the roof."
AMY," Rosa, what happened?"
AMY, Are you sure?
AMY," Great. Thanks, Charles."
JAKE, This is a bad idea. We should leave now.
JAKE," No, you're not. That is a crime."
JAKE," No, you haven't. No one has. Put that down."
JAKE, Gina! Be a quieter robber!
JAKE," Hi, we met earlier."
JAKE, Yeah.
JAKE," Whoa! Okay, everybody, just keep it cool. Everybody be chilly chill chill."
JAKE," Not chill, Dino."
JAKE," Wait, wait! The trellis won't hold all three of us at the same time."
JAKE, This is a bad idea. We should leave now.
JAKE," No, you're not. That is a crime."
JAKE," No, you haven't. No one has. Put that down."
JAKE, Gina! Be a quieter robber!
JAKE," Hi, we met earlier."
JAKE, Yeah.
JAKE," Whoa! Okay, everybody, just keep it cool. Everybody be chilly chill chill."
JAKE," Not chill, Dino."
JAKE," Wait, wait! The trellis won't hold all three of us at the same time."
JAKE," Look, it's gonna be fine. We'll get the car fixed and make it back in time. Gina, when's the tow truck getting here?"
JAKE," Yeah, I know, that's why I said call a tow truck!"
JAKE," Enough! I'm so sick of this garbage, all right? The two of you need to stop looking for signs everywhere- (Jake notices a sign giving the direction of an Airport) oh, my God, a sign."
JAKE, I'm a vessel for the universe.
AMY, Wow. The chairs look amazing. I can't believe you two aren't my biggest problem today.
AMY," Yes, we will."
AMY," Oh, no! What's happening? Someone tell me what's happening."
AMY, Oh.
AMY," The arch sucks! I'm sorry. I didn't want to say anything because you're my boss and you were so excited, but the truth is every time I look at it I wanna die and take you with me."
AMY," Oh, no. How drunk is he?"
AMY, We're ruined.
AMY, Yeah.
JAKE," Okay, this is very scary, but it's okay, because you're a trained pilot."
JAKE, What?
AMY," All right, food is ready, decorations are set, guests should start arriving any moment, and the chairs are still perfection."
AMY, All right! Let's show Rosa what we got. Wait. Where is Rosa?
AMY," Terry! What the hell, man? You said you were gonna sober them up."
AMY, This is a room of nightmares.
AMY," Okay, everybody outside now!"
AMY, Just know that you brought this on yourselves.
AMY," We're way past winkers. Scully, Hitchcock, bring the frost."
AMY," Nice job, you two."
JAKE," Hey! We're back. Pimento's got the earrings, guests are arriving- (Jake turns to Terry, Charles, Holt and Rosa) What the hell are you doing?"
AMY," Sobering these clowns up. All right, everyone go get dressed."
JAKE, You would not believe the day I've had.
AMY," You and me both, sister. Rosa got drunk, and then every time I sent someone in to help her, she got them drunk too! It's like she was trying to tank this thing."
JAKE," Yeah, well, Pimento called off the wedding three times because of the universe. If I didn't know them any better, I'd think they don't even wanna get married."
JAKE," Okay, so it seems like they don't wanna get married. But is it even our place to say something? No, right?"
AMY," Right? It's their decision, even if it's a bad one. They could always get divorced."
JAKE," People love getting divorced! My parents got divorced, and all it did was scar our family for years and years."
AMY, We have to say something.
JAKE, Yeah.
JAKE," Hey there, everyone. Great wedding so far, right? Uh, next up, we're gonna take a quick break, which happens at every wedding, but in the meantime, how about a little entertainment? Boyle? You got your devil sticks?"
JAKE," Hey, Adrian."
JAKE, We gotta talk.
JAKE, Nothing. Nothing rhymes with that. I would cut that line.
JAKE," Forget it. The thing I wanna say is, maybe the universe wasn't telling you stuff today. Maybe you were telling yourself something."
JAKE, What are you doing here?
AMY," Wow, you look beautiful."
AMY, Yeah. About that I think we should talk.
JAKE," Look, I spent the whole day denying the fact that there were signs, but I was wrong. They were actually there."
JAKE, The fact that you kept cancelling your own wedding that was the real sign.
AMY," I don't think it was an accident that you got drunk, or that you got everyone else drunk."
AMY, I don't know. Were you?
JAKE, I do not.
JAKE," All right, give it up for Charles."
JAKE," No, they are not. No one thinks that. All right, I'm not sure how much time we have, but anybody know a joke?"
JAKE," No! Sit down! No, definitely not. Oh! "
JAKE, What an interesting event.
AMY," Better than ""Sleepless in Seattle""."
JAKE, Don't take it personally.
JAKE," Hey there, Boyle. How was your weekend?"
JAKE," Oh, really? I'm sorry to hear that, man."
JAKE, No.
JAKE, Why? What's in the backpack?
JAKE, And you think that the cell phone might have Intel that could lead us to Flaco.
JAKE, I'd say it's a very-
JAKE," Okay, um, no biggie."
JAKE," Nope, very common police expression."
JAKE," This is our chance. If C.J. can't find that evidence, he could be fired. This could be our way back onto the day shift."
JAKE, Come on and party tonight. Wow! It's actually a really catchy song.
JAKE," What? No, this is our chance to undermine him. Come on and party tonight."
JAKE," Okay, you know, you're trying to say it's whatever because you just..."
JAKE," Of course I'm fumfering. Fine, we'll find the bag. Come on and party tonight. Damn it."
AMY," Oh, that's fine. It's not the thing that gives me the most pleasure in life. Interacting with other people, that's what gets me going."
JAKE," No, but I did find C.J.'s wallet, badge, and gun on top of the toilet paper dispenser. I'm assuming he doesn't know they're missing."
JAKE," Why are you helping this guy, sir? He's the opposite of everything you stand for. His favorite expression is ""that's gonna leave a mark."" And he doesn't even use it right."
JAKE, What?
JAKE," You think you're so great just 'cause you always do what's good and right. Well, I've got news for you:"
JAKE, Ya boring.
JAKE," He discovered zinc, because you've used that one on me before because, uh, ya boring."
JAKE," Wait, that was two hours? Where's C.J. during all this?"
JAKE," Party tonight. The guy's got good hooks. I mean, right?"
JAKE," Wait, who's this guy? Flaco must've sent someone to get the backpack, and they just waltzed right in and took it out of the precinct. Oh, C.J. is in so much trouble."
JAKE," You think that disapproving glare works on me after all the times I've seen it? Step it up, find something new."
JAKE, Ya boring.
JAKE," Hey, C.J., you upset about something, man? Maybe something in your career?"
JAKE," Yeah, well, you told me to sugarcoat it."
JAKE, Yours.
JAKE," Okay, so what happened? I mean, they couldn't have fired you, right? That'd be crazy. I mean, they could, for sure, they had every reason to, but did they? Did they fire you?"
JAKE," What transfer, what now?"
JAKE," Completely unqualified, yeah."
JAKE, Yeah.
JAKE," Wait, you wanna train other officers?"
JAKE, That's a six-month program.
JAKE," No, no, no, no, no, no. All is not lost. We can still fix this. So, sure, maybe you can't get back the backpack, but you could do something even better."
JAKE," Like, what if you single-handedly figure out who Flaco is and then you take him down."
JAKE," No, you won't, because I will be there to help you, but don't worry, you'll still get all the credit. Listen to me, C.J., we're gonna get you the hell out of here."
JAKE, I most certainly am not.
JAKE, Ahh.
JAKE," So, Captain, I've been thinking about this whole missing backpack thing, and, what if we find Flaco and take him down?"
JAKE," No, not at all. In fact, I think C.J. should come along. I just realized how important my duty as a police officer is to me, you know? The sacred oath I took. Your speech really inspired me."
JAKE, Yeah.
JAKE," Well, Dad, we don't know where Flaco is, but I have a C.I. who says he's got an agreement with Marco Severino."
JAKE," I know he's inexperienced, but he's a creative guy. I think he'd be great undercover."
JAKE," Great start, and I love your double use of ""muchachos."""
AMY," Oooh, that's a nice lam' job. This one goes on the blog."
AMY," Hey, Sarge, what up, bro?"
AMY, I'm sorry. I just love it so much.
AMY," What? No, don't say that. Why would you say that?"
AMY, Of course.
AMY, Uh-huh.
AMY," Oh, no, but you shouldn't feel bad, only like 10% of people pass on the first try."
AMY," That's why they say ""it's test time, so diaper up."""
AMY," They say that, I've never said that. I've never worn a diaper during test. Who would wear a diaper during a test? That's ridiculous, I mean-"
AMY," Sorry. Look, don't give up on the green initiative. You're a great sergeant. You'll get everyone on board."
AMY," Yes, Gina. You can handle her. You can do this. Sarge, it's test time."
JAKE," All right, that's Severino's restaurant. My C.I. says he's in there."
JAKE, Not at all. How about you?
JAKE," But just because you're in the van doesn't mean you're not an important part of the mission. Your job will be to keep an eye on the restaurant. And, if anybody suspicious walks in, you just-"
JAKE, Don't try and guess where I'm going with it.
JAKE," You keep an eye on the door. If anyone suspicious walks in, let us know in our ear pieces."
JAKE," C.J., I'm loving the story, but we gotta go in."
JAKE, TBC.
AMY," Of course, if you ask me, saving energy is trending."
AMY," Oh, Gina, didn't see you there."
JAKE," Hey, you Severino?"
JAKE," I'm Cal, this is Billy. We used to buy from Rosario, but he got busted by the feds, and we're looking for a new hookup."
JAKE," Well, you can ask Rosario's guys about us."
JAKE," Sorry, bad allergy day, pollen count is off the charts."
JAKE, We don't sell on the streets. We have loyal buyers that come to us.
JAKE," I'm sorry, you think we wanna deal with complete strangers?"
JAKE," I mean, we gotta cover our own asses."
JAKE, How do we know this guy's even legit?
JAKE, Shut up!
JAKE," Shut up, now!"
JAKE," Shut up, C.J."
JAKE," Yes, obviously we're cops. Put your hands up."
JAKE," Well, we can't hold him much longer, and he's not talking. The interrogation did not exactly go well."
JAKE," You're gonna tell us who Flaco is, and you're gonna tell us right now-"
JAKE," Great, I'll go get C.J."
JAKE, No reason.
JAKE," Ugh, alright, here's the truth. If we catch Flaco, and C.J. gets credit for it, he's gonna transfer out of the Nine-Nine."
JAKE," What? No! The opposite, if anything. I want to see him succeed. I'm trying to overmine him."
JAKE," Are you still mad at me for saying ""snaccident""?"
JAKE," Please, just let him come along."
JAKE, Just so his name is on the arrest report.
JAKE, I'll put him in a car a block away.
JAKE," Oh, man, if I had to boil it down to one thing and really pinpoint it, I guess I would just say it's, uh, ya boring."
JAKE, But still let him come? Great.
AMY," Gina, can I talk to you for a second?"
AMY," What? No, stop that."
AMY," I know how I kiss, I've read books. This is about Terry. You can't tell anyone else this, but-"
AMY, How do you know that?
AMY," Okay, but if you know he's depressed, then why are you being so hard on him?"
AMY, What? Ugh.
AMY, Gina? You locked me in.
AMY," Gina, you know I'm very claustrophobic."
JAKE," Parked a block away on Winthrop, as promised. Don't worry, he's not going anywhere. I downloaded an app on his phone that makes your words sound like burps."
JAKE, Yeah.
JAKE, That's Flaco.
JAKE," It's locked, go back."
JAKE," C.J., that's Flaco. You got him."
JAKE," No, no, wait. Let me guess. You opened your car door into him."
JAKE, He never saw it coming.
JAKE, And neither did you. It was a total accident; you were getting out of your car to go pee.
JAKE," Damn it, how did I not guess that?"
JAKE, Whoo!
JAKE," What, why?"
JAKE, More the door than you.
JAKE, Oh.
JAKE, That's gonna leave a mark.
JAKE," I can't believe this. Not only are we still stuck on the night shift, but now we have to watch C.J. get a medal. Why are there so many reporters? Even ""The Times"" is here."
JAKE, Stop saying reporters' names. How do you know so many names?
JAKE, Okay.
JAKE, That was a train wreck.
JAKE," Wait, what are you saying?"
JAKE, You did this?
JAKE, And you used my made-up word.
JAKE, It was no snaccident.
AMY," You did it, Sarge. You're gonna get our power usage down."
JAKE," Ladies and gentlemen, Captain Jason Stentley has been transferred from active duty effective immediately. Captain Raymond Holt will be taking his place, and, yes, he's taking all of us with him."
AMY, You mean-
JAKE," Yes, Amy. We're back on the day shift!"
JAKE, Charles! Medal of Valor!
JAKE, For getting shot in the butt!
JAKE," Oh my god, Charles is getting the same prize as a horse."
JAKE, Because the horse outranks him! This is amazing!
JAKE, The horse is pooping on the stage! Sergeant Peanut Butter is pooping on the stage!
JAKE, Santiago. The bet ends today. Are you ready?
AMY, I was born ready.
JAKE," -- to lose. The whole question was, “are you ready to lose?” And you said you were born that way."
AMY, Twist my words all you want -- I’m winning this bet.
AMY," A year ago today, Peralta and I made a bet to prove who’s a better detective. Whoever makes more felony arrests wins. What are the stakes? And don’t say money, because I know you’re in debt."
JAKE," If you knew anything about me, you’d say “crushing debt.” I’ll bet whatever, because I’m not losing."
JAKE," I’m gonna win, so sure: let’s bet the car."
AMY, Being one of those girls in Jake’s Mustang.
JAKE, That’s a very firm handshake.
AMY, I took a seminar. And now the score is all tied up.
JAKE," But not for long. In eight hours, I will win and then I will take Santiago on the worst date in the history of the world. You made your bed and now you’re going to lie in it. Don’t worry, “bed” is just metaphorical. Or is it?"
AMY," I’m not worried, ‘cause tonight I’m driving home in your car. And then I’m driving to the junkyard, where I will have it smushed into a metal cube, which I will use as a cold, sharp ottoman. Captain Holt exits his office. Charles hobbles after him."
JAKE," Rolly chair! Pen! Gina’s desk! Hello, sir, you look very stoic today. Like a majestic old tree--"
JAKE," What?! Oh, right the bet, I totally forgot--"
AMY," Up by one, Peralta! Anything you want to say to your car before you never see it again? “Bye bye?” “I love you?” “I’m sorry I let Santiago sell you for parts?”"
JAKE," Oh hi, Santiago. Do you have any dietary restrictions that Medieval Times should know about? I’m booking us a table in the middle of the jousting ring!"
AMY," Yes, 3-1-1? What’s the safest way to set a car on fire?"
JAKE, And I can see that by the absolutely no indicators on your face.
JAKE, Only if I lose. I’m a terrible sport. *
AMY, Captain! You look--
JAKE," Up by two, Santiago. I hope you got your cats a sitter tonight, because I’d hate for them to be lonely while we’re out on our date, having the time of my life."
AMY, I don’t have cats. I live alone.
JAKE, Cool brag.
AMY," You know who doesn’t live alone? The Bardon twins, whom I just busted for a B&E. Tie ballgame."
JAKE, They have the same DNA -- they should only count as one!
AMY," Ladies and Gentlemen, I present Carl Laudson, who stole 3000 dollars! left! Suck it, Peralta!"
JAKE, Oh no.
AMY," That’s right ‘oh no’-- Oh no, you don’t seem worried. Why aren’t you worried?"
JAKE," Bring in the johns! I ran a prostitution sting through Vice, and arrested thirty guys for soliciting."
AMY, That’s not a felony.
JAKE," It is if it’s your second offense. Which is the case for ten of these gentlemen. Little trivia -- four of them are actually named John! Ironic. Anyhoo, ten more for Peralta. Accept your fate!"
AMY, Never! *
JAKE," Five... four... three... two... one! It’s over. Jake wins! Amy loses! Amy Santiago, you have made me the happiest man on Earth. Will you go on the worst date ever with me? You have to * say yes!"
AMY, ...Yes.
JAKE," She said yes! She said yes! Amy Santiago! Date Time! Time to date! Hi there. Sorry, I’m taken. The woman who lives in that apartment loves me."
AMY," Peralta, this outfit is ridiculous."
JAKE," Should’ve thought of that before you spent all year losing our bet. Chop chop, there’s a lot of embarrassing to do and not a lot of hours to do it in."
AMY, Happy?
JAKE, Yes! You look like every girl I ever had a crush on at every Bat Mitzvah. Let me see the bow. Just like Jenny Gildenhorn. I wish you had braces. Should we get you braces? No -- that’s too much.
AMY, Nice shorts.
JAKE, Thank you. Believe it or not: they weren’t that expensive.
AMY, Do I really have to wear this all night?
JAKE," You know the rules. The date begins now and ends at midnight. I decide what you wear, what you eat, and where we go. Oh, and there’s one last rule."
JAKE," No matter what happens, you’re not allowed to fall in love with me."
AMY, Won’t be a problem.
JAKE, M’lady?
JAKE," Attention, everyone! Obviously, this is Charles’ night. But forget about that for a second, and admire, take pictures,and comment on every aspect of-- this."
AMY, Ugh. Permission to go to the bathroom?
JAKE," Granted. First of three. Use them wisely. Congrats again, buddy, I really am proud of you. Still wearing the medal, huh?"
JAKE," Allllright... Well, sorry I can’t stay, but I’ve got a terrible night planned for Amy. First up, the mall Photo Studio for our official date portrait. The picture will be the two of us playing one saxophone. Then, a dinner of peel-andeat shrimp at a dangerously cheap seafood restaurant. And then: I have contracted a youth choir to serenade us. * Okay, let’s hear it."
JAKE, They’re gonna sing to her at midnight in the middle of Times Square. She and 5000 German tourists will remember that moment for the rest of their lives.
JAKE," ‘Cause they’re so easy to grab, they’re begging to be pulled."
JAKE, ...What are you saying?
JAKE," Okay, that’s straight-up insane."
JAKE," Don’t worry about it. Fourteen hundred dollars. But it’s all on credit cards, so really, five dollars a month for the next 2000 years. I do not like Amy!"
JAKE," Charles, you live in your ex-wife’s new boyfriend’s basement. I don’t think I’m gonna take advice from you."
JAKE," Attention, everyone! We are about to leave, but now, for the first time as winner and loser, Santiago and I will perform the steerage jig from the film, “Titanic,” which we have in no way practiced."
JAKE, No. Embarrassing.
AMY, I hate your guts.
JAKE," Channel that passion into the dance, baby."
JAKE, Scully. Tag in.
JAKE," Sir, I’m right in the middle of this date and I can’t reschedule. I have far, far too many non-refundable deposits. I’m renting a tiger cub by the hour!"
JAKE, Don’t even know. Waiting for inspiration.
JAKE," Fine. But I’m taking Santiago, so the minute we’re done we’re back to the date. Darling? Brief pause. Duty calls."
AMY, Thank god. They head out.
AMY, I’m so happy to be out of that dress. It was weirdly hot.
JAKE," Oh yeah, it was a cotton-plastic blend. But don’t get too comfortable. We’re gonna catch these guys and get right back to the worst night of your life. Ugh. I have to cancel our theater reservation."
AMY, I don’t even want to know.
JAKE," Then I’ll tell you! It was an interactive musical called, “Uncle Milton’s Crazy Armenian Funeral.” You were going to be dragged on stage to play the nanny he died in bed with."
AMY," Ha ha. I’m so happy LaGuardia was robbed tonight. Hopefully, someone will also rob JFK."
JAKE," Don’t worry, there’s plenty of date left, including a grand finale at midnight. *"
JAKE," It’s gonna be great. For me and the kids. They get to stay up so late! * Is that the truck? Please let it be-- Nope. “Artisanal Soft Serve.” Thanks a lot, Brooklyn!"
AMY, Ten pm. These wonderful thugs have saved me another hour of humiliation.
JAKE," Yeah, well, I’m not giving up. There’s still time for us to get back to the worst date of your life."
AMY, Hmmm no. Nothing will ever be worse than the date I had with my aunt’s dentist...
AMY, What was your worst date ever?
JAKE, It’s like a fifty-way tie. Recently I went out with a lady who thought our president’s name was “The Rock Obama.”
JAKE," Hey, those people left the door open. I bet that roof has a better vantage point."
AMY, And I bet it doesn’t smell like old cheese.
JAKE, Hey. That’s offensive. It’s old meat.
JAKE," Sleep well, Brooklyn, for tonight I am your guardian. I don’t know how Batman does it. This is * so scary. Hey, can you hand me the binoculars? They’re in my stakeout bag."
AMY, Your stakeout bag is 98 percent nuts. *
JAKE," Yeah, I get snacky. Nuts are great for you, they don’t have any fat."
AMY," Jake, that’s not true at all. That is waaaay off base. They eat nuts for a beat. Amy notices something."
AMY, I think a pigeon just flew out of your car.
JAKE," Oh. Yeah, the windows don’t go up."
AMY," I don’t know why I fought so hard to get that car -- it’s kind of a piece of crap. Honestly, why are you so into it?"
JAKE, You really want to know? It reminds me of my first time.
AMY, Ewwww...
JAKE," No, not that, my first arrest. Get your disgusting mind out of the gutter. I was two days out of the academy. I’m super nervous. I see a guy run out of a * bodega with a handful of cash."
AMY, “Crushing debt.” I remember my first arrest. I was seven.
JAKE, The doll was in the right -- the robot was resisting arrest.
AMY," That’s what I said. And the judge, a stuffed owl, agreed. He was later disbarred for accepting bribes. I was a weird kid. You know, I don’t think we’ve ever just sat down and had a real conversation. It’s kind of nice. Nut? She tosses one in his mouth. He catches it. "
JAKE, Dude. Are you trying to catch it in your nose?
AMY, I got it. I got it.
JAKE," It’s Holt. Keep practicing. ...I can still make it to Times Square... * Eh, that’s okay, Captain. Don’t send the relief team. We’re already here, and I’m kind of curious to see what happens."
AMY, What did Holt want?
JAKE, Just checking in. How you doing -- any better?
AMY, Yup -- watch. The key is volume.
JAKE," Awesome. Volume me! * Tell me the truth, if you’d won my car would you really have destroyed it?"
AMY," No. I was gonna drive it...so I could learn stick. It would’ve been like... Errreggggh. Clunk! Errrrrr. Clunk. Errrr. Oh no, I just scraped off the fender! Erreggh..."
JAKE, Look. There’s our guy.
AMY, What’s the play here?
JAKE," Just follow my lead. Give me the ring. Now give me some nuts. I’m snacky. You know what, honey, fine! I’ll ask the guy, will that make you happy?! Excuse me, sir --"
JAKE, My girlfriend thinks we’re lost.
AMY, No. I know we’re lost. I think he’s an idiot.
JAKE," Idiot?! You know why we’re out here in the middle of the night, Susan? I was going to propose to you at midnight on the Brooklyn Bridge, where we met."
AMY, Brooklyn Bridge?! We met on the Manhattan Bridge! You dumb moron!
JAKE, You know what? This is over. Say goodbye to this ring and everything it stood for!
AMY, Oh! You son of a bitch! The two men hurry over. *
JAKE, Don’t tell Susan what to-- NOW! NYPD! Get down! *
AMY, NYPD! You’re under arrest! As they cuff the perps:
JAKE, Nice work.
AMY," You, too. Alright, let’s go."
JAKE," Uhhh, actually, I really need to find that ring -- it cost a fortune."
AMY, Thanks. Me too.
AMY, Yeah... right... relief team.
AMY, So... sorry you lost so much money last night. Guess you can add it to your list of bad dates.
JAKE," Nah, it goes on the good date list. You know -- ‘cause we caught the bad guys."
AMY, That’s a very mature way to look at it.
JAKE," Well, I’m a very mature man."
AMY, That’s me...
JAKE," Oh no! No, no, no, I forgot to cancel--"
JAKE," I’ll take this bullet for you, Amy!"
JAKE, Ew! I deserve a Medal of Valor for this!
JAKE, Come on and party tonight!
