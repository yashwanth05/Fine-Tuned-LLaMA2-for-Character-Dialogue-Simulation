Llama2 Fine-Tuning for Character Dialogue Simulation with Hugging Face

This notebook is a step-by-step guide to fine-tuning the Llama2 model for creating a Character Dialogue Simulation using Hugging Face tools. Key steps include:

Setup and Imports: Installing and importing necessary libraries like transformers, accelerate, and bitsandbytes.
Dataset Preparation: Loading and reformatting datasets to follow a character dialogue template for realistic responses.
Model Training: Fine-tuning the model with parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) techniques, including QLoRA, to optimize memory usage.
Model Deployment: Saving the fine-tuned model and pushing it to the Hugging Face Hub for easy access and deployment.
